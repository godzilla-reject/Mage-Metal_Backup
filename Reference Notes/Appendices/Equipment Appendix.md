> Each School grants a starting resonator, but players should feel free to replace that one with one of their own creation. A resonator should be important to the character, and needs to be hands-free. It can be abstract, such as [[Admiral Michi]]'s "Metal Resonance Precept" for her robot companion, V4G4_B0ND, or very literal and physical. One must be careful to not let a resonator become an actual magic item, as that would be a *specific resonator.* A good rule of thumb is a mundane object with one or two rolls from the [[Magical Quirks]] chart.

> ###### *Description*
> This large barrier-shield is named for an Old World shield, not a space-heater (contrary to popular belief.) This specific design also, coincidentally, has a strong resistance to high temperatures. This is strictly a coincidence.

> ###### *Description*
> This massive barrier-shield nearly fully covers the wielder. The wielder use a single Interaction action to deploy the shield's second barrier layer. When doing so, the Tower shield gains the mechanics noted in parentheses (they replace the original values) until the wielder takes a free action to change the shield back.
