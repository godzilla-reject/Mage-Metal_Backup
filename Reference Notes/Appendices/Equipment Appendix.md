> Each School grants a starting resonator, but players should feel free to replace that one with one of their own creation. A resonator should be important to the character, and needs to be hands-free. It can be abstract, such as [[Admiral Michi]]'s "Metal Resonance Precept" for her robot companion, V4G4_B0ND, or very literal and physical. One must be careful to not let a resonator become an actual magic item, as that would be a *specific resonator.* A good rule of thumb is a mundane object with one or two rolls from the [[Magical Quirks]] chart.
