> ### Details:
> Your Metal gains an Apopplia-Class A-RAID, which allows for truly autonomous piloting. As a free action, or as a part of summoning the Metal with this system installed, you can turn control over to the A-RAID system. While in this state, it functions identically to the [[SA-RAID Unit]] and you gain access to the following action:
> 
>> [!info|s-t no-i] Protocol: Apopplia's Dalliance ●
>> [[Usage\|Usage: Metal]], [[Protocol]]
>> - - -
>> You relinquish full control to the Apopplia unit, who begins her secret rendezvous with her enemies' hearts. Your Metal gains the following benefits:
>> - Your Metal's attacks with a d6 or smaller damage die gain [[Critical\|Critical 1d12]]
>> - Your Metal's attacks have their critical range increased by 1 (typically to 3, 4 and 5.)
>>   
>> Each time your Metal deals a killing blow or critical hit while in this Protocol, it can teleport up to double its Speed or right next to an enemy within Sensors, whichever distance is shorter.

>>

> ### Details:
> Your Metal gains a basic AI unit in the form of the Semi-Autonomous Robotic AI Driver.  It features a fully customizable avatar and can speak to you, but unlike a true A-RAID, it cannot form independent thought. It is solely obedient to you and will refuse the orders of others unless instructed to follow them.
> 
> You can give control of your Metal to the SA-RAID unit, allowing it to act independently. Unlike other forms of AI, you must still tell it what to do via verbal command. It can follow basic instruction statements, such as "defend this location," and it will defend itself and allies. You can issue new commands as long as you are within its Sensors Range and have the means to do so. This unit is not truly capable of emotion, and thus, cannot go Rogue.
