> ###### *Description*
> This "armor" is a layer of quilted cloth that is primarily used to separate the wearer from a set of heavier armor, such as [[Carbon Alloy Plate]] (which has a set of this armor figured into its Price.) Verocloth is sometimes used on its own, however, though it is easy to destroy and provides little protection.

> ###### *Description*
> Much like plate-mail of old, carbon-alloy plate consists of plates that interlock together to encase the entire body in an artificial carapace of nearly impenetrable carbon alloy. These suits are costly and require extreme amounts of resources and time to create. A suit of this armor has integrated [[Power-Gaunt|Powergaunts]], as well as a lining that can be used as [[Verocloth]] armor.
