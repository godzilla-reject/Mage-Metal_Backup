### Light Frames 
#### LF-001 "Side-Winder"
Super-Massive Robotic’s premier Light Frame is the Side Winder. The Side Winder was the first SMR frame designed to utilize the highly experimental Laminar-Momtion Drive to aid in near perpetual motion. This frame sacrifices Structure in order to support its higher speed and systems capacity.

#### LF-002 "Shadow-Stalker"
The *Shadow-Stalker* line exists as SMR's response to the USH Grand Military commissioning a battlefield stealth solution. It came about by retrofitting a *Side-Winder* with a host of stealth-augmenting upgrades, such as refitting the Laminar-Motion Drive channel to accommodate a Radial Vision Obscurement Device (R-VOD.)
