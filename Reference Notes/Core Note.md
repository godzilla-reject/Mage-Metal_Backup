### Attack-Type Cores
#### ATSC-001 ''Warring Dragons'' 
***Requirements: None.***

The first of the Attack Type S-R<sup>2</sup> Engine cores to be produced by Super-Massive Robotics, the *Warring Dragons* utilizes two, shall we say, ***highly adversarial*** dragon spirits to facilitate the requisite Soul-Resonance reaction. These spirits, like all other spirits used in the  S-R<sup>2</sup> Engines, are perfectly safe for the pilot*, but this model of Core has been known to cause the occasional outburst in pilots who interface with it for prolonged periods.

<sub>\*Assuming proper usage</sub>

*This Core is recommended for players who want to play a heavily conflicted, passionate character, who has strong, polarizing stances on situations and ordeals.*

### Defense-Type Cores
#### DTSC-001 ''Steelclad Mamba''
***Requirements: None*** 
First of the Defense-Type  S-R<sup>2</sup> Engine cores produced as apart of SMR’s contract with the USH military, the *Steelclad Mamba* utilizes a Spirit that is internally referred to as the *Iron Adder*\*. This spirit is a massive serpent, clad in trillions of steel plates in place of scales that it can use to create weapons and shields at will. This core, after prolonged exposure, tends to illicit protective behaviors in pilots.  

<sub>\*SMR and the USH-M are acutely aware that Adders and Mambas are two different species of snake.</sub>

### Support-Type Cores
#### STSC-001 ''Infinite Hydrangea''
***Requirements: None.*** 
 
First of the Support-Type Soul Cores, the *Infinite Hydrangea* employs a single Spirit that SMR internally refers to as ***Grovetender*** to facilitate the requisite Soul-Resonance reaction. Like all other spirits, the ***Grovetender*** is perfectly safe for Mage-Pilot exposure\*. This model of Core, after prolonged use, has been known to cause a mellowing of outbursts and increase in tender qualities in pilots. 

\*<sub>Assuming proper usage.</sub>

*This Core is recommended for players who want to fully embrace the idea of being a tender caretaker and dedicated support. Characters who are highly empathetic, inquisitive, and otherwise supportive are perfect for this Core.*

If you have no dice to spend, the healing wave heals 1 Health.

> [!embed-feat]+ ### Deus Ex Machina: *An End to the Infinite*
> You finally reach the end of the Unending Garden, coming face to face with the ***Grovetender*** to finally find what you've been searching for. If you would be tasked with finding something impossible to locate, you can invoke this Deus Ex Machina. The Escalation die is immediately set to maximum, and you must face a Test of Soul, which has been carefully determined by your GM. On a success, your Soul ignites. Replace your Potential attribute with Soul, and increase your Tier to 5.
