*”Greetings Pilot and welcome back to the Terrarium. Time since last Lunar Incursion: 709 Solar Days.”*
# Overview 
Good morning, Pilot. You’ve graciously agreed to help test the latest in USH automatic biographing technology in the form of the *Advanced Magisterial Pilot Condition and History Bio-Log* (AMP-CHB). The following document contains all of the instruction you should need to complete the test here today.

Welcome to `=[[Dev Helpers]].game-full` *Character Creation Playtest*. The goal of this test is to check the viability, stability and usability of the character creation rules for this game. The following materials are required (and should have been provided) for this playtest:
- A copy of this document. 
- A personal copy of [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11sFDvnzlPyw0b4NcCGj40xoyfQpYLrE9l6w3kMeaYho/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet. This is the playtest character sheet, and it is *not* final. It is handy due to taking the stress of math off of playtesters. 
- At least 3 six-sided polyhedral dice (“d6’s”.)
- A device capable of allowing you to fill out [this](https://forms.gle/osrYS3qtCQ6ktG6m8) feedback form. 

This is the *first* playtest of the *first* game I have ever designed. I am not promising something amazing, but it is *your* feedback that will help it *become* something amazing. This has been a passion project of mine for the better part of the last year of my life, and I sincerely hope that this first playtest can spark an interest within you, dear player, to bear with an aspiring game designer as we all delve into the *Terrarium* over the remnants of Earth Prime over this series of playtests.

The following is an overview for how to create the *Mage* that ends up being *in* the *Metal.* As you follow these instructions, read the content set out before you, and create one of the first characters within a budding universe, keep a few things in mind: 
- *What can be better?*
- *What do you enjoy?*
- *What doesn’t make sense mechanically?*
- *What DOES make sense mechanically?*

Again, I thank you dearly for being apart of this first playtest. Have fun, Pilots, and remember:

***UNITED, WE WILL SLAY THE FOUR HORSEMEN***
