Much like LANCER, Metal weapons are installed on Mounts. Multiple kinds of mount exist, which dictate what style of weapon can be installed on them.

Notes on Mounts:
- Each mount is worth a number of points
- Each kind of Frame has a certain number of points that their mounts must add up to.
- Each Type provides one mount, regardless. 

- Mounts
	- Heavy: 50
	- Primary: 30
	- Secondary: 20
	- Aux: 5
- Modifiers: These alter the points cost of a mount and can be used to round off a stray 5 or so points. Add all costs together, then multiply. 
	- /Aux: +5
		- Adds a single Aux weapon to the mount, which can be used when the other weapon is.
	- (Restriction) -5
		- The mount is restricted to what is in the qualifier.
	- Twin: x2
		- Allows for the installation of two of the *same* weapon. Twin Primary would allow for two Assault Rifles, for example.
