In *Mage//Metal*, there are "extra" resources that can be interacted with, mainly by skills. They are: 
- *Resolve* for the physical Attributes (Power, Body, Reflex.)
- *Grit* for the mental Attributes (Mind, Potential, Tenacity.)
These resources are expressed in the form of bonus dice, and are subject to the following rules:
- Multiple sources of *Resolve* or *Grit* can grant multiple dice at once.
- Multiple instances of die size increases don't stack together. They begin at d6, and max out at d12.
