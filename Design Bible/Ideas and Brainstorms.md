- Definitely gonna be using Google Sheets/Excel for the first character sheet for ease of playtesting.
	- goated idea
	- this was a bad idea, excel sucks cock
- One-shot is going to Segway into the first adventure path.
- Higher-level spells must have a certain Escalation die to use.
- Either Lancer-style Greyhawk initiative, or modal, dynamic initiative like PF2e. Could also consider a flat-stat initiative like GURPS. 
	- ~~we went with GURPS kek~~
	- Initiative needs to be dynamic to help with the intended speed of combat.
- Skills need to be re-worked. Too similar to GURPs, and feels a tad clunky.
	- ~~Prefer to keep the training system~~
		- ~~Idea: Set target number for each training level, altered by circumstance?~~
	- ~~Might want to playtest first? Conflicted honestly.~~
	- Skills will be stream-lined into the "Training-Perk" system that the rest of the game will be adapting.
