# Inspirations
*Mage in the Metal* takes great inspiration from the titans that came before it, not being afraid to wear inspiration in its sleeve.
## LANCER
The first Mecha-oriented game that the designer of *Mage in the Metal* ever played, LANCER combines freeform RP-oriented pilot play with high-powered war-game Mecha combat. LANCER’s heavily war-gaming inspired combat can be a drag for some people, but *Mage in the Metal* hopes to take that and refine into something fast, robust, and powerful.
## Pathfinder 2e
My favorite d20 fantasy system. PF2e’s robust character customization system in the form of the ABCs is something that *Mage in the Metal* hopes to take and expand on, while giving it a metal-inspired aesthetic and magic-first orientation.
## GURPS
The holy grail of crunch and customization. *Mage in the Metal* places utmost importance on letting a player’s character be their own by facilitating mechanics that allow that, and we look to GURPS for the modularity required to do so.
# Tenets
1. Ease of Use comes *first.* *Mage in the Metal* will be a system that is easy to use, easy to homebrew in, and fun to play. 
2. Complexity is never a bad thing. We don’t believe in keeping it simple just because. This game is crunchy when it needs to be, and fully embraces it.
3. My game is for ***all people.*** Hate and bigotry have no room, *ever*, in this game, and will never be tolerated. If you don’t like that, **don’t fucking play it.**. If you hate those who have less than you, I hate you.
# Philosophy
While still in the planning phase, I believe it to be very important to have a philosophy behind why I make the choices I make for *Mage in the Metal*. This section outlines this philosophy, as well as how they come together with the core design tenets to form a cohesive designing guide.
## Function over Form
In an era of simple RPGs like *Ryutama*, *Apotheosis*, and *Dungeons and Dragons 5e*, I want to see *Mage in the Metal* become a light that shines bright, telling the community that crunch is still alive and well. Mechanics exist to serve the game and facilitate player enjoyment, and if that means a mechanic needs to be intricate, then so be it. There is nothing wrong with these simple games, and I was wrong for thinking there was. Write stuff down. Mess it up. *Learn.* 
## Accessibility and Homebrew
Transparency with designers is my dream as an aspiring designer. I would love to see how the Paizo team comes up with new weapons, or how the Steve Jackson team assigns point costs. I aim to keep comprehensive design notes on the *how and the why* of *Mage in the Metal*. That way, I can allow these notes to be given to people who wish to create content for this game. Homebrew is and always will be the lifeblood of this hobby, and I cannot stand to let that go unnoticed. 
## Inclusivity
Historically, this hobby is toxic. No more. No more ableism. No more casual, thinly veiled racism. No more exclusion. *Metal* is for everyone, but my everyone **does not** include bigots. It never will.
