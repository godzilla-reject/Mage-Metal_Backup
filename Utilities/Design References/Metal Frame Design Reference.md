Each Metal, at its base level, is a Frame with thousands of wards, enchantments, and mechanics layered on top. A frame, while able to move on its own, can *only* do that. It serves no other purpose; without a Shell, it has no armor or method of carrying a pilot, and without a Soul Core, it has no particular way of actually letting the pilot use any of the systems or controls. 

## Types of Frames
Generally, Metal frames are divided into five general categories:
- Ultralight
- Light
- Balanced
- Heavy
- Superheavy
These categories are further explained in their respective sections, but generally refer to the size of the Metal, using Old Earth weight classes to describe the speed and agility of the Frame.

Frames have 7 "points" to distribute between Attribute boosts.

### Ultralight
Ultralight Frames are the fastest, which allows them to have extremely high mobility. This presents a wide set of issues, however. In order to keep weight down and speed high, these Frames have low durability, poor defenses, and little space to mount weaponry. It is also difficult to install systems on these Frames due to the bare-bones nature of them.
- Design Notes
	- Mounts must add up to 40
	- **Limits**: 
		- Structure 1
### Light
Light Frames are a step above Ultralight in terms of durability, but maintain a low weight in order to keep a still-high speed. Light frames focus on agility over speed in order to afford better weapon mounts, though non-Dodge defenses are still poor. Light frames can also afford more Systems, lending them to commonly fill the role of light, mobile support.
- Design Notes
	- Mounts must add up to 45
### Balanced
Balanced Frames are the middle of the road frames in terms of both mobility and defense, as well as a robust variety of mounts. Heavy mounts appear here for the first time. 
- Design Notes
	- Mounts must add up to 50
### Heavy
Heavy Frames sacrifice some movement for robust and powerful defense. These frames can take some punishment from direct fire, but are much easier to hit due to increased size. 
- Design Notes
	- Mounts must add up to 65
	- Can have Attributes of 4.
### Superheavy
Superheavy Frames are the pinnacle of walking fortresses. These frames are used to mount massive amounts of weapons, escort other Metals, and even act as mobile sortie points. 
- Design Notes
	- Mounts must add up to 90
	- Can have Attributes of 4.
