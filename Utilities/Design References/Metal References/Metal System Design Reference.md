- [x] #todo  Create at least 2 of each type of Metal Systems. ðŸ”½ âœ… 2024-02-12

At its most basic, a System is a module that adds new utility and/or ability to a Metal. These Systems are controlled by the central computer of the Metal, and consume certain amounts of computational ability, which are represented with *System Points.* 
## Types of Systems 
Metal Systems are divided into these general categories:
### **A**utonomous **R**obotic **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **D**river (A-RAID)
These systems integrate an AI pilot into the Metal that allow it to be piloted autonomously.
### Deployable
These systems are objects that can be deployed directly into the field from the Metal itself.
### Drone 
These systems are semi-autonomous units that can be sortied to help in combat. Typically, drone systems provide support and *not* direct firepower.
### Flight-Sys
These systems add flight capability to the Metal. 
### Barrier-Sys
These systems augment the stock Barrier of the Metal.
### Gen-Sys (General Systems)
This Type is catch-all for systems that do not fall into the other categories. 
### Mods
This system type augments a Metal's weaponry.

## System Points Balancing
Each system has a minimum cost of 1 SP and a maximum cost of 4 SP. Deployables, Drones, and Barrier-Systems all have a minimum cost of 2 SP, and any system that grants a beneficial effect of any kind to allies costs an additional 1 SP.
