Much like Mage weapons, Metal weapons also use a point-based design system to provide an internal check for balance. 

Each mechanical component has a value, and the summation of those points represents the "power" of that weapon. 

### Starting Points 

Each weapon begins as 1d6 Simple, Melee and 1-handed, on an Aux mount, with 1 point.
