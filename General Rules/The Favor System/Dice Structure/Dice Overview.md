## Basics of the Dice 
In *The Mage in the Metal*, a wide array of dice are used, spanning from a d4 to a d12, but the primary dice used to resolve all checks (and contests!) is a pool of **3d6.** These dice are used due to the even distribution of results along a curve (called a bell-curve (?)). While most other games use a d20 for resolving unknowns (this is called the game's *resolution method*), *Mage//Metal* chooses to opt for the more predictable 3d6 dice pool. This can lead to some major differences from other games, such as *critically* succeeding/failing on a roll. 
### The Check
Whenever an action is uncertain or dramatically in-doubt, the GM may call for (or perform themselves!) a **check.** This, in simplest form, is rolling 3d6 and comparing the sum of the results to a *target number* (TN), which is the value being checked, with the goal of rolling *under* the TN. 

>[!example] Example: Making a Check.
>Matthew wants his character, Whitebeard, to begin crafting a new weapon. After working with his GM to devise the specifics of the new weapon, Whitebeard's player must make a **[[Mundocraft]]** check. Matthew determines his TN by  adding, then subtracting, any modifiers to the target number, which is his **Mundocraft** skill of 20. He then rolls 3d6, sums up the three numbers, and compares the result of the die roll to the TN. He rolls a 12, and since his TN was 20, he gets a success!

### Modifiers 
In *Mage//Metal*, modifiers directly affect the *target number*, not the dice's outcome. They are divided into two forms: bonuses and penalties. As alluded to above, there is a specific order that they are applied to a target number, and those are **bonuses**, *then* **penalties**, then any division or multiplication (if any. There shouldn't be any.)
#### Modifiers: Bonuses
Bonuses come in a few different forms, and each check or contest can only benefit from *one* of each type. A bonus *increases* the target number, making it easier to roll under. 
The types of bonuses are:
- Equipment
- Magical
- Circumstance
- Fate 
#### Modifiers: Penalties
Penalties, on the other hand, all stack together. They might include a type, but this is for other mechanics to reference. A penalty *subtracts* from the target number, thus making it more difficult.

The most common form of penalty is the *difficulty* penalty; nearly all rolls will have one. 

>[!example] Example: Applying Modifiers
>To build on our previous example, creating a *brand new* weapon is quite the feat, so let's say that Matthew's GM assigns his **Mundocraft** check a difficulty penalty of -10. This would then make his TN a 10, not 20, which would then result in this becoming a failure. However, Whitebeard, as a [[Wrench Monkey]], has access to a full workshop, granting him a +4 equipment bonus to any **Mundocraft** check made there. Thus, the final TN would instead be a 14, and the roll of a 12 would still be a success (even if a narrow one!)

## Success and Failure
In *Mage//Metal*, success and failure is not a binary system; some effects rely on more than just the outcome of the roll. Some effects only have outcomes that occur on much more rare *critical* successes or failures. These occur on an outcome (the total of the dice) 5 and lower (for a critical success) or 16 and higher (for a critical failure.) Most effects, such as spells, however, will have a sliding scale of results that run the entire array of outcomes.

## Margins of Success/Failure
Another axis of outcome in *Mage//Metal* is the idea that an effect differs depending on the *margin* of success (or failure.) For example, the **[[Athletics]]** skill allows a character to make a High Jump `=[[Dev Helpers]].one-action` skill action, and part of that action's outcome is determined by a margin of success that is found by comparing the outcome (the total of the dice rolled) to the target number, finding the difference, and then seeing how many times the skill or effect's defined margin of success divides *evenly* into the difference.

## Check Versus Contest
In *Mage//Metal*, checks are used to determine the outcome of *one* character attempting something uncertain or otherwise dramatically important. A **contest** is used when there are multiple *opposed* characters attempting to beat one another at the same time. If they are tied, the character with the higher training wins. If both have the same level of training, then they are at a *true stalemate,* and another contest must be made (typically after some outside intervening to keep things interesting.)

## Favor and Fate
The final mechanic of dice outcomes in *Mage//Metal* is the idea of rolling *with favor* and *without favor.* This is the game's version of the other dice influence mechanics found in other games, such as D&D 5e's advantage/disadvantage system.

Rolling *with favor* means that one rolls 2d6 *instead* of the normal 3d6.

Meanwhile, rolling *without favor* means that one rolls 4d6 *instead* of 3d6.

These differing modes are some of the only alterations made to the actual dice pool itself, and thus, are potent effects.
