The Twin-Action Structure in the Favor System is meant to support conflict that fast-paced and engaging, with little time wasted. 

Each conflict participant has a pool of spaces they can move across the field of conflict (or battlefield) each turn, as well as two Actions they can take on each of those turns. Favor System games are balanced around this idea, with effects that generate additional actions being some of the most powerful in the game. Each participant also gets one Reaction, which can be used to do the same things actions can do, but "out of turn." Generally, most reactions can be taken during one's turn, but only if its not repeating an action already taken. This helps prevent the reaction from becoming a third action, and encourages players to explore the out-of-turn utility reactions provide.
