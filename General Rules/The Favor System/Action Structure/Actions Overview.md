## Basics of Actions 
The Favor system, and by extension,*Mage//Metal*, uses a two-action structure that is meant to support conflict that is face-paced with a focus on strategy. 

Each participant (referred to as a "combatant") has a pool of spaces (called Speed) that can be used to move across the field of conflict ("battlefield") during each of their turns, as well as two Actions (●) that can be taken.

Each combatant also gets a single Reaction (◌) that can be used to perform an action "out of turn." Generally, reactions cannot be taken during one's own turn. This is to prevent reactions from becoming a "third" action.

Finally, each combatant can also take one Free Action (○) per turn. Much like reactions, these are meant to provide utility and not overt damage or other forms of power.

## Advanced Action Economy 
Once a player is comfortable with the basics, they can begin to explore more advanced options. A combatant can forgo their reaction and free action (or movement) for a third action, but not both for four. A combatant can also spend an action to move up to their Speed again, allowing for some powerful combinations.
