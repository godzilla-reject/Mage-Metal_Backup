# Overview 
In *Mage//Metal,* there are multiple damage types, each with their own associated rules. There are *twelve* total types, divided between **physical** and **energy** types of damage. 
## Physical Damage Types
The three **physica**l damage types are:
- Cutting: Wind or blades deal this damage type. 
- Crushing: Hammers and other forms of blunt trauma deal this damage type.
- Piercing: Bullets, arrows, and other fast-moving, small objects deal this damage type. 
Any spell that deals these damage types will have the [[Physical]] trait.

## Energy Damage Types 
The nine **energy** damage types are:
- Fire ([[Fire]])
- Cold ()
- Electric ([[Electric]])
- Sound ()
- Psychic ()
- Arcane ()
- Brilliant ([[Brilliant]])
- Void ([[Void]])
- Poison ()
Any spell, and most weapons, that deal one of these damage types will have an associated trait.

## Damage Resistance and Immunity 
In *Mage//Metal,* certain armors and abilities grant Resistance to certain damage types. This allows the player or NPC to double their **final** Toughness against sources that deal that damage. 

A more powerful form of Resistance is Immunity. Being Immune to a damage type means a character does not take **any** damage from a source of that type. 

## Damage Weakness and Vulnerability 
Opposite of Resistance, Weakness to a damage type instead means the player or NPC **cannot** apply Toughness at all. If a condition or effect would give something with a Resistance to, say, fire, Weakness to it, they cancel out. Gaining a Weakness to a damage type you are instead Immune to grants you Resistance to it.

A more severe form of a Weakness is a Vulnerability. Being Vulnerable to a damage type mean a character ***adds*** their Toughness to the damage taken, as well as not applying it. Gaining Vulnerability to a damage you are Resistant to makes you Weak to it. 

### Damage Modifier Overview
Think of the modifiers as a sliding scale; Vulnerability and Immunity are the outermost bounds, with Weakness and Resistance as interior bounds and unmodified damage values sit in the center.
