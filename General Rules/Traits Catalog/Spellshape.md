> ###### Trait Information
>  Activities with this trait are used to shape and tweak the properties of spells cast. You must cast the spell directly after using an action with this trait; if you use any other actions, you waste the benefits of the action with this trait. Additional effects from actions with this trait are part of the spell, not the action.
