> ###### Trait Information
> This trait is used to show the rarity of an effect or character option. This trait is reserved for effects and options that are specific to one instance. If anything other than that entity has this trait, it is no longer Unique, it is instead Rare. Players can only use Unique options when directly given them by the GM.
