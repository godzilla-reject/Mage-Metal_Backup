> ###### Trait Information
> Weapons with this trait perform so well in high-stress situations that it is difficult to miss with them; when a creature attacks with a Reliable weapon, they can forgo rolling to hit to instead deal a number of d2s in damage equal to the qualifier of that weapon's Reliable trait. For example, if a weapon has Reliable 3, the user can forgo rolling to attack to deal 3d2 damage to their target.
