> ###### Trait Information
> This trait will always have a qualifier. For each increment of the qualifier, past the first, ranged weapons with this trait suffer a -2 range penalty. For example, the [[Lazerpike]] has a Range of 20 spaces, and if a creature was targeting an enemy that is 80 spaces away, they would take a -6 range penalty (0 for the first 20, -2 for the next, -2 for the next, and -2 for the last, for a total of -6.)
