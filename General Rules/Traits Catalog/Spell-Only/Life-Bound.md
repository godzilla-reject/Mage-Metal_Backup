> ###### Trait Information
> Spells and abilities with this trait can have their mana costs paid for with lifeforce instead of mana. When cast this way, the caster takes XdE of **true** damage, where X is the spell's Rank. Your Toughness does not apply to this damage, and you cannot reduce it by any means (unless an effect specifically says so.) Most spells with Lifebound will also include an additional effect if the caster is [[Bloodied]].
