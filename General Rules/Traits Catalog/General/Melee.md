> ###### Trait Information
> Effects with this trait can only be used in close-quarters combat. While typically used when a spell creates a temporary weapon to attack with, the Melee trait is also used to represent some alternate weapon uses, such as [[Gunblade]]â€™s Blade Strike. This trait is always accompanied by the [[Attack]] trait.
