> ###### Trait Information
> This trait will always have a qualifier. Effects with this trait can have differing amounts of actions spent on them, typically in the form of a spell's casting time. The qualifier will always give a range, with the first value being the minimum number of actions and the second being the maximum. As always, an activity with three actions prevents you from moving that turn, and an activity with four or more actions must be cast across multiple turns.
