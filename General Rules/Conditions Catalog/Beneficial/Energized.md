> Category: `=this.Category`
> This condition will always have a qualifier. While you are Energized, you regain Mana at the start of each of your turns equal to XdE, where X is the qualifier of the condition. Whenever you cast a spell while energized, it becomes harder to Counter; enemies who attempt to Counter a spell you cast while you are Energized suffer a penalty equal to the qualifier of your Energized condition. Reduce your Energized condition by 1 each turn you do not cast a spell while Energized.
