> This condition will always have a qualifier.

> While a creature is Energized, it regains XdE Mana at the beginning of each of its turns, where X is the qualifier. 
> Whenever an Energized creature casts a spell, it is harder to Counter; attempts to Counter a spell cast by an Energized creature suffer a magical penalty equal to the qualifier of the casterâ€™s Energized condition. 
> Energized creatures reduce their Energized condition by 1 at the end of each of their turns they do not cast a spell.
