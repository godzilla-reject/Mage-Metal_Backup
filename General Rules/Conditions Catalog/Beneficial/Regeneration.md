> Category: `=this.Category`
> This condition will always have a qualifier.
> 
> Creatures typically gain Regeneration via spells, though some equipment can do so as well. Regeneration always has a number associated with it. For the duration of the condition, the affected creature gains a number of Health at the beginning of their turn equal to the qualifier.
> 
> If a creature would gain a second instance of Regeneration, the effect with the *smaller* number immediately ends.
