> You lose your wit, stumbling about, unable to tell friend from foe. You are [[Off-Guard]], and you must make a TN 14 flat check at the start of each of your turns for the duration. If you fail, you must attack the closest creature to you (even if it is an ally.) You must make at least one offensive action per turn while you are confused.
> 
> Each time you take damage while confused, make a TN 12 flat check. On a success, you recover from being confused.
