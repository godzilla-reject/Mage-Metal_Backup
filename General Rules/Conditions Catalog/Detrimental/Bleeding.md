> This condition will always have a qualifier. A creature with Bleeding takes the listed damage at the end of each of their turns while they have the condition. [[Medicine#^47b51e\|Staunch Bleeding]] can be used to stop this condition; otherwise it lasts for 1 minute or a duration given by the inflicting effect. Creatures with the [[Bloodied]] condition cannot have their Bleeding staunched until they first remove that condition.
