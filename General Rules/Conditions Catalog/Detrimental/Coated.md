> Creatures are commonly inflicted with Coated by spells and effects with the [[Earth]] trait. Abrasive dust irritates the skin and eyes, as well as acting like catalyst for flames. Coated creatures roll against effects with the [[Fire]] trait without favor. Creatures that are [[Flustered]] cannot be Coated.
