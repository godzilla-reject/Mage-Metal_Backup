The following is a summary and overview of the numbers that make up the most basic mechanical aspects of characters, player and non-player alike.  

## Attributes
These are the most fundamental parts of a character. Each Attribute begins at 10, and are **rarely** changed after character creation. 
###  Power
Power is a measure of physicality and force.
Governs Carry Weight and Melee.
###  Body
Body is a measure of the robustness and physical fortitude of a charater.
Governs Toughness, and Health.
### Reflex
Reflex is a measure of agility and manual dexterity.
Governs Accuracy and Speed.
### Mind
Mind is a measure mental fortitude, education, and memory. It is _not_ intelligence. A smart character can have poor memory, and thus, poor Mind. Mind can also influence magic.
Governs Skill Aptitude and Spell Memory
### Potential
Potential is a measure of a creature’s ability to exert their influence on the world via metaphysical or meta-mental means, AKA magic. While hand-in-hand with Mind, Potential is seen by some as a form of spirituality as well.
Governs Spell Memory and Mana.
### Tenacity
Tenacity is a measure of how powerful a creature's personality and charisma is. Tenacious characters have a much easier time convincing others of things, as well as inspiring allies. Some also consider tenacity to be a meta-physical, or magical, measure of luck and fate. 
Governs Luck.

##  Statistics
Derived from their respective Attribute, different Statistics have differing formulae for calculating them. If a Stat would have a decimal, round *down.*
### Power
- Carry Weight
	- Measures how much a character can carry and remain unaffected. A character is considered encumbered when they're over half of their Carry Weight.
	- Max: Power * 12. 
- Melee
	- A bonus to melee weapon damage.
	- Power - 10. 
### Body
- Toughness
	- A character's ability to resist physical damage.
	- Body/6
- Health
	- This is a measure of how much damage a character's body can sustain before failure.
	- Max HP: Body. 
### Reflex
- Accuracy
	- A bonus to ranged attack rolls.
	- Reflex - 8.
- Speed
	- How far one can move in 6 seconds. 
	- (Reflex * 3)/10
### Mind
- Skill Aptitude
	- A measure of how many skills one can use to their fullest extent. A skill that a character has *aptitude* gains access to the Skill Perks of that skill. Not having aptitude does not affect their capacity to use that skill in any other way.
	- Mind/4
### Potential 
- Spell Memory
	- How many spells can be prepared a day.
	- Mind+Potential/4.
- Mana
	- Resource used to cast spells.
	- Potential * 2.
### Tenacity
- Luck
	- Luck is a meta-currency that players can use to fuel actions with the [[Fated]] trait.
	- Tenacity/5 (Minimum of 2.)

##  Proficiencies
Proficiencies are similar to statistics, in that they are tied directly to an attribute (typically to meet requirements), but they are tracked with training levels instead of numeric values. Each new training level in a proficiency also gains the player character a new Perk associated with that proficiency. 
### Armor  Proficiencies
- Each character is trained in one more types of armor. These armor forms are pilot-wearable suits that enhance a Mage's protections when their boots are on the ground. Armor training *also* influences how well a Mage can utilize their Metal's armor, as well. The armor forms are as follows, and are explored in-depth in the [[Armor Overview]].
