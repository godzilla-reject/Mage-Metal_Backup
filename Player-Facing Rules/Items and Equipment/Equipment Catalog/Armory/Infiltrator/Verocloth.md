> ###### *Description*
> This "armor" is a layer of quilted cloth that is primarily used to separate the wearer from a set of heavier armor, such as [[Carbon Alloy Plate]] (which has a set of this armor figured into its Price.) Verocloth is sometimes used on its own, however, though it is easy to destroy and provides little protection.
