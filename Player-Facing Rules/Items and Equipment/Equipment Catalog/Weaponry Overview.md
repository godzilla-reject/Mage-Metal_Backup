## Reading a Weapon Entry

## Weapon Groups

## Weapon Design Points System
In order to maintain a semblance of balance between each weapon, *Mages* uses a "points" system. Each component of a weapon (such as damage die size and traits) has an internal "point" value that is used to determine the "worth" of that component. 
### Starting Point
Each weapon starts at a 1d6 damage die, as a Simple, 1-Handed weapon, and 1 free point.
### Weapon Flaws
Weapons then gain extra points via taking on "flaws", which are priced at different rates. These points are presented below:

|        Flaw        |                          Details                           |                         Points                          |
|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
|      Loading       | Determines how many actions it takes to reload the weapon. |               3 points per reload action.               |
|      2 Handed      |     Increases how many hands the weapon takes to use.      |             6 points (3 for ranged weapons)             |
|       Volley       |   Gives the weapon a *further* minimum effective range.    |            3 points per each range increment            |
|     Expensive      |                  Increases weapon's cost.                  | 2 points per x1 to base cost (2 for x2, 4 for x3, ect.) |
|       Heavy        |                  Increases Heft of weapon                  |      2 points, 1.5x.                                                   |
| Increased Training |           Increases the proficiency tier needed.           |             4 for martial, 6 for advanced.              |

Once the weapon's flaws have been chose, the final pool of points for the weapon to buy its "boons" is complete.
### Weapon Boons
Weapons can then spend their points on boons, which define the weapon's characteristics. 

|         Lesser (1 point)          |      Greater (2 Points)       |         Major (3 Points)          |

|          [[Integrated]]           | [[Repeating]](per extra shot) |           [[Critical]]            |

| [[Reliable]] (Ranged, per 1 die.) |        [[Devastating]]        | [[Reliable]]  (Melee, per 1 die.) |
|                                   |                               |                                   |
