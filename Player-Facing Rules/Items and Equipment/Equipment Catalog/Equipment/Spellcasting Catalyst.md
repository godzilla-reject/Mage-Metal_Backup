> ###### *Description*
> This is a catch-all equipment entry to represent any general catalyst. Catalysts are the way a Mage brings a spell to life; it is step two in the bridge from The Slip to real-space. 
> Each School grants a starting catalyst, but players should feel free to replace that one with one of their own creation. A catalyst should be functional and possess a unique, weak, magical quirk.
