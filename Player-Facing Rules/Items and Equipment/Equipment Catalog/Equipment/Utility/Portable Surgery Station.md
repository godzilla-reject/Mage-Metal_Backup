> ###### *Description*
> The USH-M Standard Medical Practice Portable Theater, or "backpack hospital" is a massive medical kit that can collapse into a moderately-sized package that can be somewhat easily transported. The station can be used to perform any Medicine action that requires a surgery suite, though operating in the field has its own difficulties.
