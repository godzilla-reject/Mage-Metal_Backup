> ###### *Description*
>This filtered, air-supplied mask can be used to allow the wearer to breathe in oxygen-devoid environs, such as hostile worlds, subaquatic locales, and the vacuum of space. Nearly all suits of armor can integrate a Rebreather, allowing the wearer to still be protected in these adversarial environments.
