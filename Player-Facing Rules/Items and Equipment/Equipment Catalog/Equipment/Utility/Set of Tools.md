> ###### *Description*
> This is a catch-all for any set of tools that can be used to facilitate a function; [[Mundocraft]] and [[Artifice]] both require a set of tools for specific uses. For example, a weapons fabricator would use a Set of Tools (Weaponcraft), while an alchemist would use a Set of Tools (Potioncraft). These specific qualifiers are GM-decided. Other uses include a Weapon Maintenance Kit or a Lockpick Set.
