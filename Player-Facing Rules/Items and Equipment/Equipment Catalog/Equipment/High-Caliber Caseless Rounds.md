> ###### *Description*
> In the modern day of the Hegemony, standardization is the name of the game. Many of the old-world calibers of firearm have been broken down into the slick, new, modern Unified Solar Hegemony Military-Standard (USH-S) internally-propelled 14 mm "Wall-Wrecker" round. Due to being caseless, these rounds can be transported in small, densely-packed, containers. These rounds are sold in cases of 48.
