> ###### *Description*
> An Integrated Weapon is a piece of cyberware that can be integrated into an existing cyber-limb as one of it's upgrades. After the upgrade is installed, a weapon of any kind may be installed into it with two hours of downtime and a [[Mundocraft]] (Expert) check with moderate difficulty. The weapon then gains the [[Integrated]] trait.
