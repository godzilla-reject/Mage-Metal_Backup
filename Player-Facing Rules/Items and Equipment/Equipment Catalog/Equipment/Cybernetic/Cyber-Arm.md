> ###### *Description*
> This fully-machine arm is meant to replace an appendage that has been lost or otherwise discarded. It is just as functional as a normal arm, but gives the user a weakness to [[Electric]] effects, like all cybernetics do. Cyber-arms can be fit with up to *two* upgrades, typically in the form of something like an [[Integrated Weapon]].
