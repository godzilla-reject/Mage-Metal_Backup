> ###### *Description*
> This is a catch-all equipment that represents any general Grimoire. 
> Grimoires are tomes (or other reservoirs ) of knowledge that Mages tap into when they bring a spell to life; it is step one in the process of casting a proverbial hand into The Slip and pulling a spell from it. 
> Each School grants a starting grimoire, but players should feel free to replace it with one of their own creation. To create a grimoire, pick a mundane item that is capable of storing information, such as a book, tattoos, or even esoteric metal rings, and then pick or roll for an option from the Magical Quirks chart: `dice: [[Magical Quirks^magical-quirks]]`.
