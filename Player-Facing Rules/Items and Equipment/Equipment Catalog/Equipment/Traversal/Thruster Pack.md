> ###### *Description*
> Commonly used by asteroid miners and comet farmers, an industry-standard Thruster Pack is essential to zero-g navigation. They are also commonly used in-atmosphere, but are much less effective due to a pesky issue called "physics."
> In a zero-g environ, the wearer gains a Flight Speed of 6 sp. (as long as they have the other equipment necessary.) In atmosphere, however, the wearer makes **Jump (‚óè)** checks with favor, and the wearer can travel an additional 2 spaces as apart of that action, provided they moved any at all.
