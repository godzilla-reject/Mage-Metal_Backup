> ###### *Description*
> In the modern day of the Hegemony, standardization is the name of the game. Most old-world calibers of firearms have been boiled down into the modern Unified Solar Hegemony Military Standard (USH-S) internally-propelled 6.62 mm "Thumper" round. These rounds are caseless, which allows them to be versatile and light. These rounds are sold in cases of 24.
