> ###### *Description*
> This is a catch-all equipment entry to represent any general resonator. A *resonator*, which is typically a necklace or pin, is a magical object that can be used in conjuction with a catalyst and grimoire to open a Slipbridge, or portal, to one's Metal in order to summon it in times of crisis. 
> Each School grants a starting resonator, but players should feel free to replace that one with one of their own creation. A resonator should be important to the character, and needs to be hands-free. It can be abstract, such as [[Admiral Michi]]'s "Metal Resonance Precept" for her robot companion, V4G4_B0ND, or very literal and physical. One must be careful to not let a resonator become an actual magic item, as that would be a *specific resonator.* A good rule of thumb is a mundane object with one or two rolls from the [[Magical Quirks]] chart.
