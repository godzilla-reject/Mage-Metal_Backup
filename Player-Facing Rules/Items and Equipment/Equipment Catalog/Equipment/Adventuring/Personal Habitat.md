> ###### *Description*
> This small, climate-controlled shelter comes fully equipped with pressurized air conditioning and oxygen recyclers, as well as vertical mounting and subaquatic capabilities.  These features allow for camping and resting in any environ, sans the vacuum of space. 
> Other features include an integrated bedspace, climate monitor, and noise cancelation. Multiple habitats can connect together as well, allowing allies to traverse between each other's spaces.
> While extremely resistant to the effects of climate and weather, the Habitat is quite vulnerable to damage, and as such, affords no protection from weaponry of any kind.
