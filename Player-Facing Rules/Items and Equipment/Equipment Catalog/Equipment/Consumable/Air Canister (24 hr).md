> ###### *Description*
> This large canister of a highly breathable mixture allows one to breathe for 24 hours in an oxygen-devoid environment, given that the user has a way to use it, such as a [[Rebreather]]. These can also be attached to a [[Personal Habitat\|habitat]] of some form to allow for resting and camping in oxygen-devoid environs.
