> ###### *Description*
> Referred to as the "hacker's journal," the Toolkit is a bashed kit that can, in theory, access nearly any piece of information or machine on the Hypranet. The Toolkit is required to use most [[Hacking]] skill actions. On its own, this program can be used to see network flow, traffic, and user count on any network the user can access.
