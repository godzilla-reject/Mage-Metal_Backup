> ###### *Description*
> Bow weapons fire long shafts with ordinance at one end and flight-stabilizers at the other. These were once referred to as "arrows," though it would be more apt to say that the modern bows of the Hegemony fire missiles, not arrows. These are one such missile, and they come equipped with a local-area guidance system and a relatively-small yield payload. These Smart-Arrows are sold in quivers of 6.
