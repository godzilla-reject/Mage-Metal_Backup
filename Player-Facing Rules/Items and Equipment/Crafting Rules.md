## Crafting Overview 

## Mundane Engineering: *Mundocraft*
Most, if not all, normal crafting is in `=[[Dev Helpers]].game-short` is handled through this skill. Crafting can be done in two ways: *rush crafting* and *complex crafting.* 

> [!info|right ttl-c txt-l ws-med] Item Schematics
> In order to make an item, you need a *schematic* to reference. You gain access to the schematics of all *common*, *legal*, items by purchasing a copy of [[The Craftsmans Handbook]]. You can also take apart items to create a schematic for it; this process takes 2 hours per Tier of the item, and you need the item itself, which is destroyed in the process.

### Rush Crafting
This is the primary mode in which most things will be created, if a player wants to do so.

### Complex Crafting 
*These rules will be available in a future playtest.*

## Magical Engineering: *Artifice*
Artifice is the simple idea of combining mundane objects with immense and unstable magical power, threatening to unravel the very material at any time. Simple, right? Maybe. At its most basic, artifice only requires an object and a spell to be bound unto that object. While this is, in theory, an easy process, it is much more complex than just *any* spell being shunted into just *any* object.

Certain spells, typically called *wards*, can be easily inscribed into armor (and buildings.) Other certain spells, known as *runes*, are easily inscribed into both weapons and grimoires, though enchanting an active grimoire can be quite the challenge. 

### Spellscribing 
The process of placing runes and wards upon items, called *spellscribing*, is primarily done through the *Etch Spell* **[[Artifice]]** action, which is printed here for reference:

*Insert action here.*

#### *Wards* 
Armor can have *two* different types of wards instilled into them:
- *Integrity* wards, which enhance the armorâ€™s protection and add resistances.
- *Special* wards, which add new functionality and quirks to the armor. These wards can Resonate as well, allowing them to be used to enhance a Metal. 
  
A given piece of armor (such as a suit or shield) can have one Integrity ward and a number of Special wards equal to the *Tier* of its Integrity ward. 
#### *Runes* 
Wardscribing and Runescribing
*Modified rune slot mechanics*
- Wards: Armor enchants.
- Runes: Weapon/Spellbook enchants.

## Metal Forging 
*If a player wants to craft their own Metal, instead of commissioning it from the Forge Houses, these rules are for them.*
