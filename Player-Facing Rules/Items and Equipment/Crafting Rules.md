## Crafting Overview 
## Mundane Engineering: *Mundocraft*
Most, if not all, normal crafting is in `=[[Dev Helpers]].game-short` is handled through this skill. Crafting can be done in two ways: *rush crafting* and *complex crafting.* 

> [!info|right ttl-c txt-l ws-med]+ Item Schematics
> In order to make an item, you need a *schematic* to reference. You gain access to the schematics of all *common*, *legal*, items by purchasing a copy of [[The Craftsmans Handbook]]. You can also take apart items to create a schematic for it; this process takes 2 hours per Tier of the item, and you need the item itself, which is destroyed in the process.
