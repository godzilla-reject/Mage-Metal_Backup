# `=this.Class` Frame "`=this.Title`"
The largest Frame ever manufactured by Super Massive Robotics, the Colossus was named for the Old Earth "Colossus of Rhodes", which was thought to be the first Metal created by mankind. The Colossus represents the pinnacle of human engineering and piloting ability, as no other species have ever had a pilot that could use one. Due to sheer size, a pilot must use the Cerebral-Interfacing Colossus Control (CICC) System, which uses complex wards and enchantments to allow the pilot to see as the Colossus does. Some pilots believe this Frame should be outlawed due to the system required for a single pilot to use it, as the Colossus has allegedly been known to “test the spirit” of its pilots.
