The *Shadow-Stalker* line exists as SMR's response to the USH Grand Military commissioning a battlefield stealth solution. It came about by retrofitting a *Side-Winder* with a host of stealth-augmenting upgrades, such as refitting the Laminar-Motion Drive channel to accommodate a Radial Vision Obscurement Device (R-VOD.)
