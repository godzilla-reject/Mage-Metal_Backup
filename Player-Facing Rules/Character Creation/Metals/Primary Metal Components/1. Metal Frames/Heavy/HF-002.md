A unique take on the standardized *Lightweight* heavy frame, the *Thunder Drum* model replaces the integrated system of its predecessor with the “Taiko” Ally Reinforcement Array. While still outfitted with robust integrated armor and warding, this frame was designed to exploit high system capacity in order to provide powerful battlefield support.
