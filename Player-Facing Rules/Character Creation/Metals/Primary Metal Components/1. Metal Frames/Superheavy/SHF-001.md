# `=this.Class` Frame  "`=this.Title`"
The SMR *Kaiju* superheavy frame is the top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art, heavy engagement platform. It was created as a homage to the Star Beasts of Mars, and as a way to kill them as well. Standard Metal Size 3 frames are *exceptionally* difficult to pilot, and the *Kaiju* is even more temperamental than other frames.
