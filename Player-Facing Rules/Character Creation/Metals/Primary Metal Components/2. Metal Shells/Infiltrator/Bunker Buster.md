# `=this.file.name` Shell 
***Requirements:*** *[[Long-Range Ordinance]] Pilot Role*

Two words: payload delivery. This Shell allows Metals to get "dug in," increasing Sensor range while crippling movement in order to avoid flanks on stationary artillery delivery.

>> [!metadata] *Basic Intrinsic:* Entrenchment `=[[Dev Helpers]].free-action`
>> *This is the Shell's Intrinsic Ability*

>> *Frequency: Once Per Round*
>> - - -
>> You convert your method of movement (legs, typically) into a stationery intrenchment, allowing you to stabilize your shots and increase perception. Your Speed becomes 0, and your Sensor range is doubled. This transformation lasts until you spend one action to reconfigure.
