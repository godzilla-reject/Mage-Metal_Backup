# `=this.file.name` Core 
***Requirements: None.*** 
 
First of the Support-Type Soul Cores, the *Infinite Hydrangea* employs a single Spirit that SMR internally refers to as ***Grovetender*** to facilitate the requisite Soul-Resonance reaction. Like all other spirits, the ***Grovetender*** is perfectly safe for Mage-Pilot exposure\*. This model of Core, after prolonged use, has been known to cause a mellowing of outbursts and increase in tender qualities in pilots. 

\*<sub>Assuming proper usage.</sub>

*This Core is recommended for players who want to fully embrace the idea of being a tender caretaker and dedicated support. Characters who are highly empathetic, inquisitive, and otherwise supportive are perfect for this Core.*
