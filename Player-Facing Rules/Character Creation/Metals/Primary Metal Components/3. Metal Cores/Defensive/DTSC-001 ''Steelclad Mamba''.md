# `=this.file.name` Core 
***Requirements: None*** 
First of the Defense-Type  S-R<sup>2</sup> Engine cores produced as apart of SMR’s contract with the USH military, the *Steelclad Mamba* utilizes a Spirit that is internally referred to as the *Iron Adder*\*. This spirit is a massive serpent, clad in trillions of steel plates in place of scales that it can use to create weapons and shields at will. This core, after prolonged exposure, tends to illicit protective behaviors in pilots.  

<sub>\*SMR and the USH-M are acutely aware that Adders and Mambas are two different species of snake.</sub>
