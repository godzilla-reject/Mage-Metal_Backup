# `=this.file.name` Core 
***Requirements: None.***

The first of the Attack Type S-R<sup>2</sup> Engine cores to be produced by Super-Massive Robotics, the *Warring Dragons* utilizes two, shall we say, ***highly adversarial*** dragon spirits to facilitate the requisite Soul-Resonance reaction. These spirits, like all other spirits used in the  S-R<sup>2</sup> Engines, are perfectly safe for the pilot*, but this model of Core has been known to cause the occasional outburst in pilots who interface with it for prolonged periods.

<sub>\*Assuming proper usage</sub>

*This Core is recommended for players who want to play a heavily conflicted, passionate character, who has strong, polarizing stances on situations and ordeals.*

> ***Gozuryū's Pentafocus*** When you cast a spell or fire a weapon that has the [[Air]], [[Earth]], [[Fire]], or [[Water]] traits, you become [[Energized\|Energized 1]], or increase your Energized condition by one, up to a maximum of Energized 4. If you cast a spell or fire a weapon with the same trait more than once in a row, your Energized condition does not increase.

> ***Tiamat's Singular Point*** When you cast a spell or fire a weapon that has the [[Air]], [[Earth]], [[Fire]], or [[Water]] traits, you gain a  +1 *stacking*, *cumulative*, magical bonus to damage that has one of the aforementioned traits. This bonus stacks up to +4, and does not increase if you cast a spell or fire a weapon with the same trait more than once in a row.

> [!embed-feat]- ### Deus Ex Machina: *`=this.Deus`*
> You finally confront the war between the spirits that reside in the core of your Metal, and in turn, the war within yourself. If you would be faced with a choice that you truly find no way to resolve, you can invoke this Deus Ex Machina. The Escalation die immediately is set to maximum, and you must face a Test of Soul, which will be determined by your GM. On a success, your Soul ignites. Replace your Potential attribute with Soul, and increase your Tier to 5.
