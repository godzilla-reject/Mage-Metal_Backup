# `=this.file.name` Core 
***Requirements: None.*** 
The first of the Attack Type S-R<sup>2</sup> Engine cores to be produced by Super-Massive Robotics, the *Warring Dragons* utilizes two, shall we say, ***highly adversarial*** dragon spirits to facilitate the requisite Soul-Resonance reaction. These spirits, like all other spirits used in the  S-R<sup>2</sup> Engines, are perfectly safe for the pilot*, but this model of Core has been known to cause the occasional outburst in pilots who interface with it for prolonged periods.
