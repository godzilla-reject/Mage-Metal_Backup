> ###### *Description*
> 
> This small, square boxgun of seeking missiles is named for one of the first ever firearms made by humankind on Old Earth. While not exceptionally powerful, the Micro-Cannons are easy-to-use and reliable even in close quarters situations due to being one of the few pieces of artillery that can be used within Engagement range.
