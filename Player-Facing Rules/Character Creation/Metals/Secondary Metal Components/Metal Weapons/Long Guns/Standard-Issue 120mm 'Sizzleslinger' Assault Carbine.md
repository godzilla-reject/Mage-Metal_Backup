> ###### *Description*
> While at the Pilot level, weaponry is dominated by Elven and Dwaurven engineering, when it comes to needing the biggest guns, it is Humankind of Terra Prime that takes the cake. 
> 
> This massive assault carbine manages to have bunker-busting 120mm rounds while still being more maneuverable than any other primary.
> 
> Called the ‘Sizzle-Slinger’, this USH-M Standard Issue rifle sits as the best-in-class.
