> ### Details:
> Your Metal gains a basic AI unit in the form of the Semi-Autonomous Robotic AI Driver.  It features a fully customizable avatar and can speak to you, but unlike a true A-RAID, it cannot form independent thought. It is solely obedient to you and will refuse the orders of others unless instructed to follow them.
> 
> You can give control of your Metal to the SA-RAID unit, allowing it to act independently. Unlike other forms of AI, you must still tell it what to do via verbal command. It can follow basic instruction statements, such as "defend this location," and it will defend itself and allies. You can issue new commands as long as you are within its Sensors Range and have the means to do so. This is not a truly capable of emotion, and thus, cannot go Rogue.
