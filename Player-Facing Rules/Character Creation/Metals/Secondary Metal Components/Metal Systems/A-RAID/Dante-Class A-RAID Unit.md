> ### Details:
> Your Metal gains a Dante-Class A-RAID, which allows for truly autonomous piloting. As a free action, or as a part of summoning the Metal with this system installed, you can turn control over to the A-RAID system. While in this state, it functions identically to the [[SA-RAID Unit]] and you gain access to the following action:
> 
>> [!infobox|left s-t no-i]- Protocol: Dante's Inferno ●
>> [[Usage\|Usage: Metal]], [[Protocol]]
>> - - -
>> You relinquish full control to the Dante unit, who begins a journey across the Hell that is the battlefield. Your Metal gains the following benefits:
>> - Your Metal's Speed is doubled.
>> - All Melee attacks deal additional damage equal to your Metal's marked Heat.
>>   
>> At the end of each of your turns in which your Metal is using this Protocol, your Metal marks 1 Heat. At the end of your 9th turn after activation, your Metal clears all Heat, returns to full Health and Barrier, gains the [[Stunned]] condition and exits this Protocol.
