# Attributes 
A Metal's Attributes are slightly different from a Mage's; they lack the "mental" Attributes of a Mage-Pilot (which are Mind, Potential, and Tenacity), as well as a measure of reaction speed (Reflex) due to these things being pilot-dependent. It is still the pilot in control, after all, and Metals aren't quite capable of truly acting on their own.
