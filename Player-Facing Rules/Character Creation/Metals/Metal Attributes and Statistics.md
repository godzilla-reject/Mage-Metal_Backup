# Attributes 
A Metal's Attributes are slightly different from a Mage's; they lack the "mental" Attributes of a Mage-Pilot (which are Mind, Potential, and Tenacity), as well as a measure of reaction speed (Reflex) due to these things being pilot-dependent. It is still the pilot in control, after all, and Metals aren't quite capable of truly acting on their own. 
## Structure = ((Power + Body)/2)
This is the measure of the physical construction and ability of the Metal. 
Governs: Health, Toughness, and Melee Damage Bonus 
## Engineering = ((Reflex + Tenacity)/2)
This is a measure of the quality of the design of a Metal, and this dictates how far one can push the limits of their Metal.
Governs: Heat Limit, Shields, Speed
## Computation = ((Mind + Potential)/2)
This is the measure of the computational ability of the on-board abilities 
Governs: Systems Points (SP), Sensor Range, Ranged Accuracy Bonus
# Statistics
Derived from their respective Attribute, different Statistics have differing formulae for calculating them. If a Stat would have a decimal, roundÂ *down.*
## Structure 
- Health 
	- How much punishment a Metal's hull can sustain before facing Integrity failure.
	- Max Health=Structure
- Toughness 
	- A Metal's resistance to damage.
	- Structure/3
- Melee Damage Bonus 
	- A bonus to Melee damage. 
	- Structure - 15
## Engineering
- Heat Limit 
	- How much heat the S-R<sup>2</sup> Engine can accrue before entering [[Meltdown]], and then [[Criticality]]. 
	- Max Heat: Engineering/2
- Barrier 
	- An meta-ablative barrier that further protects from damage.
	- Max Shield = Engineering * Tier
- Speed 
	- How far a Metal can move in 12 seconds. 
	- Engineering/2
## Computation  
- Ranged Accuracy Bonus
	- A bonus to ranged *attack rolls.*
	- Computation - 15
- System Points 
	- How many systems the on-board computer can run in parallel.
	- Computation/8
- Sensor Range 
	- How many spaces the Metal's perception sensors can detect other Metals and creatures.
	- Computation
## Unkeyed 
These are stats that do not have a keyed Attribute; they are free-standing.
- Integrity 
	- Metals do not enter a death spiral when reduced to 0 Health; instead, they mark off one Integrity and go back to full Health. When a Metal reaches 0 Integrity, it is destroyed.
