# Attributes 
A Metal's Attributes are slightly different from a Mage's; they lack the "mental" Attributes of a Mage-Pilot (which are Mind, Potential, and Tenacity), as well as a measure of reaction speed (Reflex) due to these things being pilot-dependent. It is still the pilot in control, after all, and Metals aren't quite capable of truly acting on their own. 
## Structure
This is the measure of the physical construction and ability of the Metal. 
Governs: Health, Toughness, and Melee Damage Bonus 
## Engineering
Governs: Heat Limit, 
## Computation
Governs: E-Res
# Statistics
## Unkeyed 
These are stats that do not have a keyed Attribute; they are free-standing.
### Integrity 
Metals do not enter a death spiral when reduced to 0 Health; instead, they mark off one Integrity and go back to full Health. When a Metal reaches 0 Integrity, it is destroyed.
