#  `=this.file.name`
*First of the Founders of the Hegemony, Humankind is a barbaric, bloody, and war-driven race with the unique ability to form a pack-bond with nearly any creature or inanimate object in the known universe. Many, including their Hegemony contemporaries, think them to be too short-sighted, but it is this short-sightedness that has taken humankind to the stars, past the Fringe, and into deep space. With their home planet annihilated by the Apostels, Humankind now calls the Terrarium home.*

The youngest of the three major species in the Sol system, humankind once called Old Earth home, but after it was torn asunder by the first coming of the Apostels, humankind constructed the Terrarium to act as a new home and center of the budding United Solar Hegemony. This new empire, the first of its kind in the Milky Way, allowed the species of Sol to consolidate enough power, resources and intellect to finish Project New Steel, which gave the Hegemony the first truly mass-produced Metals, as well as the ability to train Mage-Pilots en masse. 

As for the attitudes of humankind, we are all *too* familiar with how driven humankind is, lest it be by passion, lust or war. 

If you seek to play a Mage-Pilot who desires the throes of combat and harbors limitless potential, the Humans of Nowhere might be for you. Humans are complicated. They know. 
## Characteristics
### You Might…
- Seek to manifest your ideals at all costs.
- Desire a new Earth for humankind.
- Form relationships and friendships with all peoples easily.
### Others Probably…
- Respect your capability to fit into any niche and find a role in any situation.
- Fear you seek only blood and death.
- Find it difficult to form expectations of you. 
## Physical Description
Humans are highly adaptable, and due to their tragically short life-spans, evolve to fit new environments quickly. As such, their appearance is highly dependent on climate, with sunny, bright or hot environments causing humans to have darker skin while colder climates give rise to humans with much lighter skin tones. 

Humans can have hair and eyes of nearly any color. In previous times, this was limited to only select colors, but awakening humankind’s latent magic seems to have caused new mutations that allow for the full color spectrum to be expressed. Humans will typically have hair and/or eye color that relates to the type of magic they have the most talent in. 

Humans reach physical maturity around the age of 15, though they are unique in that they do not reach *mental* maturity at the same time (that typically happens around age 25.) A typical human can live for roughly 90 years, though some can live longer. Humans also have a highly mutable two-helix DNA structure, which allows them to intermarry with nearly any other species and produce offspring that bear traits of both parent species. The most notable of these half-humans are the eladryn, or half-elves, and the gnomes, or half-dwaurves.

It’s complicated, they know. 
## Society and Culture
Humans have a long, varied and rich history of doing two things: fighting and reproducing. Humans, despite all originating from the same small group on Old Earth, grew to hate one another across their long history, only learning to put differences such as skin color and sexual preference aside when faced with an extinction-level climate crisis during the final centuries of Old Earth. 

Now, in modernity, Humankind shares the common burdens of being the leading species of the Hegemony and having no place to call their own. They bear constant reminder of the destruction brought to Earth, looking down on its remnants from the massive space-city known as the Terrarium. 

Culturally, humankind still widely varies across each group and niche; this constant state of change makes humankind seem to lack a concise culture and empire. It’s complicated, they know. 
## Morality and Religion
Humans are widely superstitious, even if they claim not to be. The idea of “luck” and “fate” are both distinctly human in that *something random could just happen.* Nearly all other species believe that there is a reason for all things, but humans instead think that *randomness* is the core aspect of the universe that drives all things.

Despite this die-roll driving force, humans are strict about both morality and religion, having waged many a war over both. The issue is that no two groups of humans can actually agree on one religion or moral code. It’s complicated, they know. 
## Naming Tendencies 
Humans, at least cosmically, have pretty simple names. A birth name, given by parents, and a surname, or family name. Humans are also widely known to choose a completely different name and go by that, ignoring their given name. Still other groups of humans use naming schema from dwaurves or elves, and even still others might not even have names at all! It’s complicated, they know.
