#  `=this.file.name`
*One of the three Founding People alongside Dwaurvenkind and Humankind, the Elves are a mystical, superstitious and martial people dedicated to their endless pursuit of understanding perfection. Those foreign to the City-States of Venus consider the Elves to be esoteric, cold and brutal. Those who are willing to shelter from the burning heat of the Venus landscape in the grand pyramids, however, know that the Elves are, in fact, brutal, and maybe even esoteric, but they are ruthlessly dedicated to an idea of fulfilment others can barely fathom.*

First of the species of Sol to leave their planet, Elves lived in the shadows of Old Earth until humankind was ready to take their baby steps into the stars. The elves were quick to ratify the United Constitution of Sol, which sits in stark contrast to the Dwaurves. 

Much like the Martians, Elves also have a history soaked in blood, though not their own. Descendants of an intergalactic race of uber-warriors, elves warred amongst themselves across the cosmos until they quite literally blew themselves back to the stone age. This happened long before the advent of humankind on Old Earth, and much of this history has been lost to the endless eons. To lose history, or any other knowledge, is to fall off of *El Camino a la Perfección*. 

Elves seek perfection through both mystical and mechanical, but through martial as well. Elves are astute fighters, who are quick to act but slow to win, loving to toy with their prey on the battlefield.

If you wish to play a Mage-Pilot who seeks to understand the universe through magic and metal, shed brilliant blood, and preserve history, the Elves of Sol are right for you. 
## Characteristics
### You Might 
- Be slow to trust and form bonds due to your extreme lifespan.
- Never break bonds once they are formed.
- Seek to understand a very narrow corner of reality in pursuit of *El Camino a la Perfección*.
### Others Might 
- See you as “odd” or “unusual” due to the stories told of Elven tradition.
- Assume you are a perfectionist, to your detriment.
- Adore, or slight, you for your people’s dedication to knowledge and religion. 
## Physical Description
Elves stand taller than the average Human by about one foot, standing roughly seven feet tall on average. They have lithe, wiry frames, with slightly-too-long limbs. Most elves are thin, though there is just as much possible variation between body types as humans.

Most who have never seen an elf typically have an issue telling apart "male" elves from "female" elves. This is primarily due to elves’ lack of sexual dimorphism and facial androgyny. Elves possess no secondary sex characteristics, and possess the capacity to change their reproductive organs at will.

Facially, elves typically possess sharp features and pointed ears, though some House bloodlines have rounded or even squared ears. Elves also cannot grow facial hair. 

Elves have an exceptionally long lifespan, living normally around 1,000 years. This leads to the timescale of their perception working fundamentally differently to other mortalkind. Elves normally come of age at 200 years old, as this is when they first typically hear the Summoning for the first time. The Summoning, a curse upon the very blood of the Elves, summons the deepest instinct of their warrior-race past, driving them into an animalistic frenzy roughly once every fifty years.
## Society and Culture
While the Dwaurves warred against nearly unconquerable beasts on Mars, Elves were in an arms race of their own; they were desperate to find a way to fight the slow collapse of Venus’ atmosphere. 

After being set back to a stone-age level of technology at the very end of the Forerunner War, elves used remnants of their ancestor’s technology to accelerate technologically at an alarming rate, eventually shedding concepts such as war in favor of peace to unite against the common problem. As such, elven society, even now, is still leagues ahead of the other Sol species. The elven idea of philosophy is that war is unneeded, but violence is an acceptable answer and that technology is the only way forward. This stands in stark contrast with the Summoning, the magical curse put upon Elven blood. 

In time, these opposing forces have come to conflict, and now harmony. Each elf is taught the ways of war, the ways of magic, and the ways of technology. This three-fold path is essential to an elf’s development in spirit, body, and mind, and their society seeks to perfect them all. 

## Morality and Religion
Classically, the Elves follow the Tradition, a religion formed from the fundamentalist ideas of the Forerunners in which they are descendants of. The Tradition is a wild combination of martial blood-sport, flesh sacrifice, ritual sexual acts and convoluted rituals. This "religion" is not followed openly in the modern day of the Hegemony, but it is *felt* throughout Elven society. There are some sects who still follow the Tradition, and believe that the Summoning is tied to straying from the Path set forth by the Tradition.

In modernity, elves follow the Three-Fold Path, or *El Camino a la Perfección*. This can be summed up as the idea that, in order to lead a perfect life, one must perfect their body, soul, and mind. Past this, the elves idea of “morality” is the pursuit of making life fair for all things, if not equitable. 
## Naming Tendencies 
Elves choose their own names in accordance to their pursuit of the Three Paths, as well as have a name that is given to them at birth and their House name.
