#  `=this.file.name`
*One of the three Founding People of the Unified Solar Hegemony, the Dwaurves are a hearty people, stern and powerful. Strangers consider them to be too work-centric, putting their working lives ahead of all else aside from family and drink. Those who have spent time within the cold, dry air of the Martian stone-cities, however, can attest that they are a zealous people, dedicated to family and craft with an unparalleled passion only found miles below the Martian dessert.*

Dwaurves were the last of the Founding Peoples to ratify the United Constitution of Sol, and many attribute this to the fact that they are slow to trust outsiders. In their own history, they have a long past of constant warfare; the horrors of Mars refuse to let even a single drop of blood go unearned. When something is won of a dwaurf, lest it be blood or honor, that pact is kept eternal. 

If you seek to play a Mage-Pilot who can survive any horror of the cosmos, dedicate a heart of iron to their allies, and brandish wanton loyalty, the Dwaurves of Sol is right for you. 
## Characteristics
### You Might...
- Remain loyal to those you consider forge-sibling, no matter their petty slights against you.
- Have an eye for all things stone and metal, knowing pinnacle craftsmanship when you see it.
- Refuse to break or back down when given the chance to do so.
### Others Probably...
- See you as, frankly, a *stubborn ass.* Some say this is an asset, though most claim it to be a liability.
- Assume you are a heavy drinker.
- Respect, or fail to, the deep connection you hold with your family, clan, and clade.
## Physical Description
Dwaurves are shorter than the standard Human by about one foot, standing around five foot on average. They boast wide, compact bodies, built on burly frames. Dwaurves of all genders are fully capable of growing thick, curly beards, which they often braid into intricate arrays of complex patterns that are specific to their job, family, clan, and clade. Long beards and short head hair are a sign of masculinity and leadership amongst them, while thin, face-hugging beards and long, flowing hair is a powerful sign of femininity. Clean-shaven, bald dwaurves are dishonorable, untrustworthy, and unclean.

The Dwaurves of Mars typically mature into adulthood around age 50, though each clan has more specific coming-of-age ceremonies that draw the line of adulthood in other ways. A dwaurf's lifespan is around 400 years, though death is typically regarded as something a dwaurf must agree to.
## Society and Culture
Long before the Venusian Elves claimed the moons of Saturn, or mankind grasped the dust of their moon, the Dwaurves fought against the other *natives* of Mars: the Starbeasts. Natively named for the sounds Dwaurven hunters made when running from them, these animals represent the bulk of the history of the Dwaurves; that is, an arms race against a species of ever-evolving megafauna. As such, craftsmanship of new and better weapons was the name of the game, and the only place they could do so was deep in the caverns of Mars.

Today's dwaurves, having nearly hunted the Starbeasts to extinction, still maintain a production-based, group-minded culture. This is merely a broad-stroke for them, however. Culture varies vastly between the different stone-cities, and even between clades within the cities. Most dwaurves, even still, share a passion for the finer aspects of metallurgy, stonework, masonry, and gem-cutting. Most enjoy bare-hand brawling, architectures, and mining as well. 

Each dwaurf is given an *icon* at birth; this represents their clan and clade. This icon is typically a weapon, though it varies. To have an icon taken is an ultimate crime, and to freely part with it is an ultimate dishonor. 
## Morality and Religion
While quite a bit more secular than both humans and elves, dwaurves do have a primary religion: The Steel Pact, which is named such for the original Dwaurf, Adaman, forging a pact with the Serpent of the Heavenly Steels at the dawn of creation. This pact afforded a boon to Adaman: he was granted the ability to wield the Six Heavenly Steels, which are mythical metal alloys that hold magical properties. In modern times, the Pact is highly metaphorical; each alloy represents a balancing act between two opposing forces in the world, such as the Sixth Steel, Tyrannium, representing the balance between the need for leadership and the desire of tyranny. 

Most dwaurves are lawful in nature, and while they are quite selfless, they are also very protective of their own and warry of outsiders, leading some to declare them quite neutral parties. A strong sense of justice helps define them further as a people who work hard, but play even harder. 
## Naming Tendencies 
Dwaurves have, admittedly, quite complex naming conventions. A dwaurf's full name is their chosen name (selected when they come of-age), their given name (the name given by their birthing-parents), their family name, their clan name, and their clade name. Given names are normally a virtue, while chosen names are normally relevant to the individual's coming-of-age.
