> ## Details:
> You have an addiction to seeking and casting the strongest spells imaginable. You always cast spells at the highest Rank you can, and refuse to cast Rank 0 spells unless completely out of Mana. Additionally, you must cast at least two spells of the highest Rank you have access to each day or you begin to undergo withdrawal. While in withdrawal, you make all **Body** and **Mind** checks without favor (this includes associated skills and proficiencies.) At the end of every day you are in withdrawal, you take a -2 penalty to your Potential Attribute. If you would reach 0 Potential, you must undergo the [[Rite of Harmony]] or similar powerful healing magic to restore your connection to the arcane.
