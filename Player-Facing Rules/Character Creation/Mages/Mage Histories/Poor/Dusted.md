# Description-`=this.file.name`
Referred to as such due to the amount of exhaust dust that coats the slums, you are one of the Dusted. The Dusted sit at the lowest of Terrarium society, being relegated to working the hydroponics yards or super-factories, both of which pay little. The Dusted are also not allowed to leave the slums without special permission, typically gained via a lucky job opportunity or pilot academy scholarships.

>> As one of the Dusted, you are effectively invisible to people of higher classes. Most non-violent crime you commit goes unpunished due to the fact enforcers rarely want to interact with you. You can also get access to the Slumsâ€™ black markets and other hubs of non-regulated activity with ease.
