Whether it be from musical talent, video essays, or an All_Your_Fans, you sit at the height of a media community cultivated by your own hand. You maintain a wealthy, comfortable lifestyle in the Terrarium, but also live at the mercy of trends and your fanbase. After all, without them you are *nothing*.

>> [!info|text-Center clear] Perk: `=this.Perk`
>> You can use your fans for small tasks that require little physical action. When exploring or during downtime, you can implore your fanbase to attempt to locate a person, location, or other information accessible via the Hypranet. This information cannot be classified, though it can be otherwise kept secret. There is a chance of failure, however, and using this perk, regardless of success, requires you to take a week of downtime to produce content to keep your fanbase happy.
