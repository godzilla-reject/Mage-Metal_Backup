# School of  `=this.file.name`
The most spiritual of the Elemancy schools, hydromancers flow from state to state, using frozen ice as well as scalding steam to bring calamity.
### Starting Equipment.
You begin play with the following equipment:
- Catalyst: A wristband with bright blue water in it, which changes states with your spells. It melts in anyone elseâ€™s hands, reforming around your wrist.
- Grimoire: A water-proof scroll that wraps around your forearm. Its text washes off when held by anyone else, soaking them in the process.
- Resonator: A chunk of permafrost bound to a necklace.
