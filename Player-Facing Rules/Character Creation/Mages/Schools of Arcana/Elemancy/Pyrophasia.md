# School of  `=this.file.name`
Harnessing the power of wicked flame, practitioners of this school, typically known as *pyromancers,* bring immolation through desolate flame. Despite this wanton destruction, their flames can give new life the chance to rise.
### Starting Equipment
You begin play with the following equipment:
- Catalyst: A palm lighter, with an important name engraved on it. It is too hot for anyone else to hold.
- Grimoire: A matchbook that always seems to have matches. Each stick is rune-scribed with with spells. It always seems to find its way into your pocket.
- Resonator: A small piece of black-charred wood that always seems to smolder. This flame does not cause harm or spread. It is affixed to a small necklace.
