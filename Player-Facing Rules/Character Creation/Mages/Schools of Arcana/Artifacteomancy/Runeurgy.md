# School of  `=this.file.name`
Sometimes called scribes, runeurgists are masterful practitioners of the most basic component of spell-work: language. Magic is a language a Mage speaks with the universe, and runeurgists are exceptionally fluent. 
### Starting Equipment.
You begin play with the following equipment:
- Catalyst: A large writing utensil with your name etched across it. It never seems to run out of ink.  
- Grimoire: A tome who's pages are blank to anyone other than you. Only your catalyst can inscribe within it.
- Resonator: A vial of pitch-black ink, strung on a necklace.

## When you select  this School,  select  a  Path. 

>[!column]- ***Path of `=this.Path1`:*** 
>> [!metadata] *Trained Perk: Bound in Ink*
>> *When you become Trained in this School, you gain the following benefits.*
>> You can cast spells by drawing their spoken components in ink instead. Any spell you cast with the [[Vocal]] trait is cast as if affected by the *Silent Spell* spell-shape, but this is *not* a spell-shaping effect. Additionally, your grimoire is the canvas of your skin; any spell you learn becomes tattooed onto your skin, and your prepared spells' tattoos glow with a faint ebb and flow.
