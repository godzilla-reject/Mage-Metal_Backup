# School of  `=this.file.name`
Technomancers have a special relationship with the Metals; instead of seeing them as resonators for magical power, they view them as extensions of the self. Most technomancers augment their bodies with cybernetics and magitech in order to feel closer to their Metals.
### Starting Equipment.
You begin play with the following equipment:
- Catalyst: A [[PiC-Mi]] (Personally-Integrated Computer Machine Interface)
- Grimoire: A copy of [[Cybermagistic Solution's Grim-Ware]] software.
- Resonator: One cybernetic enhancement.

>> Once per hour, you can attempt to code a new spell on-the-fly as a free action. Pick one spell you have access to but do not have in your grimoire. Roll a **Spell-Works** check, with a penalty equal to the spell’s level. On a success, you can cast the spell. On a failure, you suffer feedback, and cannot cast a spell for a round.
