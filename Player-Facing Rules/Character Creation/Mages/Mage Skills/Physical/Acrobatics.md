# Skill Actions
#### Untrained Actions
These actions can be performed without any training in `=this.file.name `; they are available to any character. 
> [!note]+ ##### Maintain Balance ●
> [[Move]]
>- - -
>  You move across a narrow surface or uneven ground. Make an **Acrobatics** check. On a success, you move across the area as if it were difficult terrain (each space takes 2 spaces of movement), or as normal on a critical success. On a failure, you must remain in place to not fall, and on a critical failure, you instead fall from your position.

> [!note]+ ##### Tumble Through ●
> [[Move]]
>- - -
>  You attempt to move through an enemy's space. As you do so, make an **Acrobatics** contest against the enemy's **Reflex** (or Dodge.) On a success, you move through their space, treating it as difficult terrain. On a failure, the enemy stops your movement, triggering reactions as if you *began* to Move in front of them, and can Reposition as a free action.

#### Trained Actions
These actions can be performed by characters who are *Trained* in `=this.file.name`; they are not available to characters with lesser training.
> [!note]+ ##### Acrobatic Maneuver ●
> [[Move]]
>- - -
>  You attempt a complex maneuver, such as repeating backflips or a contortion. Make an **Acrobatics** check. On a success, you perform the maneuver. On a failure, you fail to do so, with the repercussions being appropriate to the attempted maneuver. A maneuver should *not* allow you to replace another skill, though it *can* grant a bonus to one, such as a character using a *bullet jump* to gain a bonus to Dodge. In such a case, the action that would get a bonus can be performed as a free action with a trigger of a successful maneuver.
