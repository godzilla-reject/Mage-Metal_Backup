# Skill Description-`=this.file.name`
Meta-Magic, or the art of *shaping the spell*, is just as much an artform as it is a science in that, fundamentally, its neither. In order to warp a spell as it is being cast, one must have a great deal of understanding of both magic as a whole and the spell itself, and this skill is neither of those things. Instead, this skill is the “cheater” way out: meta-magic, truly, is the easy route of using *additional* Potential to warp the spell from the *outside.* This includes rendering *other* spells inert. 

When you become trained in this skill, you learn three trained spellforms. When you increase your training further, you learn three spellforms of the new training level and 1 more of each level below it; for example, when you become a master of Meta-Magic, you learn three master spellforms, one expert spellform, and one trained spellform. Spellforms are detailed at the end of this skill entry.

You may then choose to spend additional mana equal to the total spellform value *or* attempt a **Meta-Magic** check with a difficulty penalty equal to the total spellform value.

# Spellforms 
## Trained (0-2)
- Energy Ablation Barrier (2)
	- You gain Resistance to the damage type of the next spell you cast until you either use this spellform again or the end of your next turn. 
- Non-lethality (0)
	- Your spell is less deadly. It gains the [[Nonlethal]] trait as long it doesn’t deal negative damage or have the [[Death]] trait. 
- Concealed Spell (0)
	- Your spell gains the [[Subtle]] trait, becoming much more difficult to notice. 
- Widen Spell (1)
	- If the next spell you cast does not have a duration, you add 2 spaces to a burst, 2 space to a line or cone under 3 spaces or smaller, or 1 spaces to a larger cone or line. You can use this spellform multiple times, stacking its effect. 
- Reach Spell (1)
	- You can extend the range of spells. Increase the range of the next spell you cast by 6 spaces. If the spell is touch, the range becomes 3 spaces. You can use this spellform multiple times, stacking its effect. 
- Counter Spell (X)
	- You can use your spell shaping to render a foe’s spell inert. When you use this spellform, Shape Spell becomes a reaction, and this spellform’s value becomes the Rank of the spell you are attempting to counter. Make a **Meta-Magic** check with a difficulty penalty equal to the triggering spell’s rank. On a success, you can spend mana equal to the total spellform value to render the spell inert, or half that on a critical success. On a failure, the spell occurs as normal.
## Expert (3-5)
- Cryptic Spell (5)
	- You hide your magic in the swaying of trees, the croaking of frogs, and the flicker of fires. As you cast your next spell, if you are not directly observed, the effects of that spell are displaced into the natural environment, nearly unable to be determined as magic without special sensors or senses. This requires *plausibility*; you cannot hide summoning your Metal in the wind, but you *can* hide it in the rumbling of an earthquake or bubbling up from the swamp. 
- Martyr (3)
	- If your next spell cast would restore Health to an ally, you can lose 1d6 Health per Rank of the spell to restore extra Health equal to the amount you lost. Additionally, you can use this spellform to give your Shape Spell action the [[Life-Bound]] trait (independently of the first effect.)
- Drain Mana (3)
	- Requires Counter Spell
	- Your Counter Spell spellform is much more powerful when you reinforce it. You only need to spend half the mana of the total spellform value on a success, and on a critical success, you regain 1d12 mana. 
- Alter Fundamental: Damage (4)
	- You can change the damage type of the next spell you cast. If it is a physical damage type, it must remain so. The same is true for energy.
- Alter Fundamental: Attribute (5)
	- You can change the targeted attribute of the next spell you cast. For example, if that spell normally required a **Potential** check, you can change it to a **Power** check. 
- Sow Spell (5)
	- You fold the spell into a seed, planting it into meta-reality. You make all decisions regarding the spell, and then tuck it away into the seed. Within the next ten minutes, you can direct the sown spell to flower as a reaction with a trigger of a creature entering the spell’s range. The seed flowering causes the spell to activate as if you just cast it.
## Master (6-8)
- Overwhelming Force (6)
	- Your next spell ignores Resistance to one damage type. You can use this spellform multiple times, and each time you do, the spell ignores one more Resistance.
- Quicken Spell (8)
	- If the next spell you cast is at least two ranks under your maximum, reduce the number of actions it takes to cast by 1.
- Encumber Spell (X)
	- You can use your spell-shaping to make a foe’s spell harder to cast. When you use this spellform, Shape Spell becomes a reaction, and this spellform’s value becomes the Rank of the spell you are attempting to hamper. The target spell gains the [[Slow]] trait. If that spell is already Slow, it takes a further additional action. If this would prevent the spell from being cast, the caster instead becomes [[Slowed|Slowed 1]].
