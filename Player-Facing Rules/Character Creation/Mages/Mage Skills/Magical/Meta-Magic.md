# Skill Description-`=this.file.name`
Meta-Magic, or the art of *shaping the spell*, is just as much an artform as it is a science in that, fundamentally, its neither. In order to warp a spell as it is being cast, one must have a great deal of understanding of both magic as a whole and the spell itself, and this skill is neither of those things. Instead, this skill is the “cheater” way out: meta-magic, truly, is the easy route of using *additional* Potential to warp the spell from the *outside.* This includes rendering *other* spells inert.
