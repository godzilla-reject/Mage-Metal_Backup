# Skill Actions
#### Untrained Actions
These actions can be performed without any training in `=this.file.name `; they are available to any character. 
> [!note]+ ##### Perform 
> [[Exploration]], [[Concentrate]], [[Usage\| Usage: Mage]]
>- - -
>Whenever you attempt to perform for an audience in some form, such as playing your instrument, singing one of your songs or dancing an exotic dance, you use this activity. This is mostly used when you need to make an impression on someone important in the audience, and rarely has a direct impact on its own. Competence is assumed; unless there is a chance of failure or real stakes, you should not be making any checks. 
>
>At the start of your routine, make a **[[Performance]]** check. This action gains the [[Somatic]] trait if you use physical gestures or the [[Auditory]] trait if you use something vocal.

>
>On a success, you prove your ability to your observers and they appreciate the quality of the performance, and on a critical success, they are highly impressed. 
>
>On a failure, you fall short of your own personal standards, though the performance is not necessarily *bad.* On a critical failure, however, you demonstrate a failing of some form; you might choke a high note, whiff a solo, or suffer a flubbed move. 
#### Trained Actions
These actions can be performed by characters who are *Trained* in `=this.file.name`; they are not available to characters with lesser training.
> [!note]+ ##### Inspire ●●
> [[Concentrate]]
>- - -
> With a quick note, rapid kata or some other brief performance, you rally the troops, inspiring others. Make a **[[Performance]]** check. On a success, you and all allies within a 6-space emanation gain 1d4 temporary Health. This action gains the [[Somatic]] trait if you use physical gestures or the [[Auditory]] trait if you use something vocal.
#### Legendary Actions
These actions can be performed by characters who are *Legends* in `=this.file.name`; they are not available to characters with lesser training.
> [!note]+ ##### Pluck the Strings of Fate ◌
> [[Fated]]
>- - -
> ***Trigger:*** A check is made and you are aware of it.
> You use your mythical power of performance to alter fate itself. Make an *impossible* **[[Performance]]** check, spending as many Focus dice as you want. Regardless of outcome, you cannot use this reaction again until you enter a death spiral. 
> 
> On a critical success, you change the outcome of the triggering check to whatever you wish. This *can* be a specific number, even if that result is not normally possible.
> 
> On a success, you change the outcome of the triggering check to your desired outcome (critical success, success, failure, or critical failure), and then enter a death spiral. 
> 
> On a failure, you may change the outcome by one degree (critical success to success, success to failure, etc.) You then enter a death spiral.
> 
> On a critical failure, you are met with a terrible fate. Roll a 1d4. 
> 1. You outright die. You are resurrected by Fate after 366 days in a random location. 
> 2. You lose all knowledge of performance, becoming Untrained and losing all perks, for 366 days.
> 3. Fate steals your mana. You cannot cast spells for 366 days.
> 4. Those closest to you forget your face. All allies forget who you are for 366 days.

# Perks
>> [!info|text-Center clear] Trained Perk: Triumphant Inspiration
>> *When you become Trained in `=this.file.name`, if you have aptitude in it, you gain the following benefits.*
>> Whenever you successfully use _Withstand Pain,_ you gain a _Focus_ die, which is a d6. You can have a number of Focus dice equal to your _Tier multiplied by 2_. 
>> 
>> As a free action, you can spend 1 Focus die and add the result to a check an ally makes. This **must** be done *after* the check is made, but before the outcome is learned. Only one such bonus can be added to any given check. 

>> [!info|text-Center clear] Expertise Perk: Distracting Performances
>> *When you become an Expert in `=this.file.name`, if you have aptitude in it, you gain the following benefits.*
>> Your Focus die size increases by 1 step (to a d8.)
>>

>> *When you become a Master in `=this.file.name`, if you have aptitude in it, you gain the following benefits.*
