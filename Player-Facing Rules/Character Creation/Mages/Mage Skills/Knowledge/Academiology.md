# Skill Description-`=this.file.name`
In the Hegemony, knowing things is easy; nearly everyone has access to the Hypranet at nearly all times, thus making “general knowledge” all-the-more general. However, knowing *specific* things, such as the history of Old Earth bridge architecture? That is the realm of Academiology, the study of studying. The Knowledge of Knowing. Those well-versed in academiology can tell you *utterly useless* information at a moment’s whim, though if you’re asking it might not be all that useless. 

This skill works slightly differently than other skills. When you increase your training in it, or for a small XP cost, you can define a *specialty* for this skill. Academiology specialties are narrow selections of knowledge that your character is well-versed in. While this skill is useful without a specialty, it really shines when being used in a case that one can be applied. Feel free to define your own specialty, just make sure that the GM approves of it!

Some examples include:
- Accounting
- Art 
- Circus 
- Farming 
- Law
