# Skill Description-`=this.file.name`
In the Hegemony, whle most general knowledge is widely available through the Hypranet, the knowledge of magic itself—Arcanology—is *not*. Magic is a fickle thing, coming in a wide array of methods and functions, and Arcanology is the study of both the method and the function, the *A* plus *B* that gets *X*, so to speak. 

Arcanology is *not* required to know how to actually *cast* spells. That would be Spell Work. This skill is instead for the underlying mechanics *of* magic itself.
