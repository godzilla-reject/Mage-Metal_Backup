# Skill Description-`=this.file.name`
In the Hegemony, whle most general knowledge is widely available through the Hypranet, the knowledge of magic itself—Arcanology—is *not*. Magic is a fickle thing, coming in a wide array of methods and functions, and Arcanology is the study of both the method and the function, the *A* plus *B* that gets *X*, so to speak. 

Arcanology is *not* required to know how to actually *cast* spells. That would be Spell Work. This skill is instead for the underlying mechanics *of* magic itself.

# Skill Actions
#### Trained Actions
These actions can be performed by characters who are *Trained* in `=this.file.name`; they are not available to characters with lesser training.
> [!note]+ ##### Borrow Spell 
> [[Concentrate]], [[Exploration]]
>- - -
> You can attempt to prepare spells that other mages have in their grimoire. Make an Arcanology check with a difficulty penalty equal to the Rank of the spell. 
> 
> **Success** You prepare the spell as though it were in your grimoire; you can cast it as you would any other spell until the next time you undergo daily preparations.
> **Failure** You do not prepare the spell. You can prepare one of your own spells as normal, and you cannot try to borrow that same spell until the next time you undergo daily preparations. 

> [!note]+ ##### Learn A Spell 
> [[Concentrate]] [[Exploration]]
>- - -
> You take some time to learn a new spell, inscribe it into your grimoire, and gain access to wielding its power. You do so either by being taught by another mage, or, less commonly, by teaching yourself from a scroll, recovered grimoire, or other source.
> 
> To learn a spell, you must follow the following steps. The spell you are attempting to learn must be within the Ranks allowed for your Tier, and your grimoire must have an open slot for a new spell (it can hold a number equal to your Tier times 10.)
> - Spend 1 hour per rank of the spell studying and practicing the spell, in which you must have access to either a teacher or the magical writing for the whole duration.
> - Have any materials needed for the spell you are learning.
> - Attempt an **Arcanology** check with a difficulty penalty equal to the spell’s rank. Uncommon and rare spells have a higher penalty; -3 for uncommon, and -6 for rare.
> 
> **Success** You add the spell to your grimoire.
> **Failure** You fail to learn the spell, and must wait a number of days equal to its Rank to attempt again.
> **Critical Failure** As failure, except if you have previously critically failed to learn this spell before, you can *never* learn it. 

> [!note]+ ##### Identify Magic
> [[Concentrate]], [[Exploration]], [[Secret]]
>- - -
>You can take about ten minutes to try to determine the specificities of an ongoing magical effect, magical location, or magical item. If this time is interrupted, you must start over. Make an **Arcanology** check, with a difficulty penalty equal to the Rank of the magical effect. Cursed objects and places, or exceptionally esoteric subjects, usually have a further penalty added, or might even be impossible to identify this way. 
>
>**Critical Success** You learn all details of the magic; you learn its name and rank, what it does, means of activation, and if it is cursed.
>
>**Success** You learn the name and rank of the magic, as well as what it does. If it is an item or location that can be activated, you get a vague idea of how to do so.
>
>**Failure** You fail to identify the magic and cannot do so again for one day. 
>
>**Critical Failure** You misidentify the magic, being told false information as though you critically succeeded.

# Perks

>> [!info|text-Center clear] Trained Perk: Reliable Recognition
>> *When you become Trained in `=this.file.name`, if you have aptitude in it, you gain the following benefits.*
>> You can Identify Magic in only one minute, rather than 10, or as a two-action activity if you are a Master in Arcanology. Additionally, you automatically succeed at the Recognize Spell reaction if the target spell is 3rd-Rank or lower. This goes up to 6th-Rank and lower if you are an expert, 9th and lower if you are a master, and 12th and lower if you are legendary.

>> [!info|text-Center clear] Expertise Perk: Arcane Shorthand
>> *When you become an Expert in `=this.file.name`, if you have aptitude in it, you gain the following benefits.*
>> You are highly adept at learning new spells, and as such, you have engineering your own arcane shorthand for your own grimoire. Your grimoire can now hold *tier times 15* spells, rather than *tier times 10*, learning new spells takes half the time it would otherwise (minimum of one hour), and you cannot critically fail when attempting to learn new spells. Finally, your shorthand renders your grimoire difficult to decipher; spells learned from your grimoire are considered to be uncommon due to your shorthand. 

>> [!info|text-Center clear] Masterful Perk: Magic Item Adept
>> *When you become a Master in `=this.file.name`, if you have aptitude in it, you gain the following benefits.*
>> You can use any magical item, even if you do not meet the requirements. In order to do so, you must attempt an **Arcanology** check as part of using the item. This check has a difficulty penalty equal to the item’s Rank. On a success, you can activate the item as normal. On a failure, nothing happens. 

>> [!info|text-Center clear] Legendary Perk: Grand Unified Theory of Potential
>> *When you become a Legend in `=this.file.name`, if you have aptitude in it, you gain the following benefits.*
>> You have an acute understanding of how Potential is manifested into metaphysical form, or mana, which is then burned up to warp local reality, aka magic. Due to your in-depth knowledge of this process, you can take…shortcuts. Once a day, you can cast a spell without spending mana, using the environmental Potential coefficient instead of your own. If you do, roll a d2. On a 1, the spell is cast at its lowest Rank; on a 2, it is cast at its highest level. If the die lands on its side, not showing either face, the spell is cast as though it were 12th Rank, regardless of if it has an up-cast effect. After casting a spell this way, all spells you cast until the next time you rest has its mana cost doubled.
