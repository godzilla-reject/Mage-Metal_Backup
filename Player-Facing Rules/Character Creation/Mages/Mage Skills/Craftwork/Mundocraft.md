> [[Usage\|Usage: Mage]], [[Exploration]], [[Manipulate]]
>- - -
> You spend about 10 minutes performing routine maintenance and attempting minor repairs. At the end of the time, make a **`=this.file.name`** check with a Standard difficulty for your Tier. On a success, any equipment with *minor damage* is repaired to *working order*, and any with *major damage* is repaired to *minor damage.*

#### Trained Actions
These actions can be performed by characters who are *Trained* in `=this.file.name`; they are not available to characters with lesser training.
> [!note]+ ##### Rush Crafting 
> [[Usage\|Usage: Mage]], [[Downtime]], [[Manipulate]]
> - - -
> Using your skills with engineering and manufacturing, you attempt to create an item from raw materials in a timely manner. 
> 
> To rush craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
> - The item is your Tier or lower. Tier 2 items require Expertise in Crafting, Tier 3 and 4 items require Mastery, and Tier 5 items require Legendary.
> - You have the *schematic* for the item; see the aside in [[Crafting Rules]] for more information.
> - You have an appropriate set of tools and/or a workshop. Most items, in theory, *could* be made with *just* the correct [[Set of Tools]], but a workshop will **always** help. 
> - You have access to a supply of raw materials equal to half of the item’s Price. Typically, you can front this cost, given you could access them normally. In some cases, rare materials will be needed that cannot be simply purchased.
>   
>   You then spend 3 days at work, at which you then make a **`=this.file.name`** check with a Hard difficulty for your Tier. The TN of this check is further modified based on the item’s Tier, rarity, legality and complexity. 
>   
>   If you are successful, the materials are expended. You can then choose to pay the other half of the item’s Price to complete the item immediately, or  you can spend additional days working on the item equal to the item’s Tier. At the end of those days, the item is finished. 
>   
>   On a failure, your effort is wasted, but you can salvage the materials and try again at no penalty.
>   
>   On a critical failure, you ruin 25% of the materials you used, losing them.
