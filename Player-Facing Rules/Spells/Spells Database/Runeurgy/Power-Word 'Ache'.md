> You utter a single word that commands a creature to writhe in pain. Pick one target within range. They must make a **Mind** check. On a failure, they become [[Immobilized]] until the end of your next turn. On future turns, you can Sustain this spell to renew the effect. At the end of the duration, or when you stop Sustaining this spell, the target takes 1 **true** damage for each turn they were affected by the spell.
