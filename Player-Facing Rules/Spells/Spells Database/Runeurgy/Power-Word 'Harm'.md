> Your voice echoes across the battlefield, and you utter a single esoteric word that carries an echo of the Empty Nothing on its clamor. Pick one target within range. They must make a **Tenacity** check. On a failure, they take `dice:1d4` **void** damage the next time they would take damage. On a success, the target takes 2 **void** damage.
