> ###### *Details*
> With a slam, you coax forth earthen spikes from the ground in the Area. These spikes deal `dice: 1d4` **piercing** damage to creatures in the affected spaces. For the duration, the area these spikes occupy are **lesser** difficult terrain, and you can shatter the spikes in a space to make any creature in a 6-space cone in front of that space [[Coated]]. If there are no more spiked spaces, the spell ends early.
