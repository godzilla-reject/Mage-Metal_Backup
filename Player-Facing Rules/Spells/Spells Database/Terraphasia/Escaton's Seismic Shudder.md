> ###### *Details*
> You leap into the air, crashing down into a space within range. All creatures within the Area centered on the space you land in take `dice:1d4` **crushing** damage. At the end of your turn for the next 3 rounds, you repeat this crashing leap, with the die size increasing by one step (to d6, then d8 and then d10.)
