> ###### *Details*
> You flicker a small orb of lightning into existence in a space within range. A massive bolt of lightning then erupts from that space, dealing `dice:3d12` **electric** damage to all creatures within the spell's area. Those creatures must make a *basic* **Reflex** check. On a failure, or if the creature has a Weakness to **electric** damage, they also become [[Shocked]] for 1 minute.
