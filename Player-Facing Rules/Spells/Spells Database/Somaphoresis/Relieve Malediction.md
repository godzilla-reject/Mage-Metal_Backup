> ###### *Details*
> You relieve the target of an ailment or malediction. Pick one ally within range. You must then make a Medicine check. On a success, you end one detrimental condition afflicting that ally. On a failure, that ally immediately takes damage from the condition, if applicable, and on a critical failure, one of their conditions persists for another minute (chosen at random.)
