> ###### *Details*
> *Whenever you cast this spell, pick one of the following modes.*
> ***Ice Mode*** 
> You hurl a frigid ice spike. Make a ranged spell attack. If it hits, you deal `dice:1d6` cold damage. On a critical hit or damage roll of a 6, the spike is stuck in the target.
> ***Steam Mode***
> You superheat local water vapors to scald a foe, dealing `dice:1d4` fire damage. A target within range must make a **Body** check. If the target is [[Frozen]], or impaled by an ice spike, Scald deals `dice:2d4` damage instead.
