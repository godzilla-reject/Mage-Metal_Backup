> ###### *Details*
> *Whenever you cast this spell, pick one of the following modes.*
> 
>  ***Ice:*** You hurl a frigid ice spike. Make a ranged spell attack. If it hits, you deal `dice:1d4` **cold** damage. On a critical hit, or damage roll of a 4, the spike is stuck in the target. When this mode is used, `=this.file.name` gains the [[Attack]] trait.
> 
>***Steam:*** You superheat local water vapors to scald a foe, dealing 2 **fire** damage. A target within range must make a *basic* **Body** check. If the target is [[Frozen]], or impaled by an ice spike, Scald deals `dice:1d8` **fire** damage instead.
