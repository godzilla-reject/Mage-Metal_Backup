> ###### *Details*
> *Whenever you cast this spell, pick one of the following modes.*
> 
> ***Spout:*** Choose a space within range. A spout of water erupts from that space, pushing all creatures within the area. All creatures within the Area must make a **Body** check. On a failure, they are knocked [[Prone]] and pushed to the edge of the Area. This spout persists for the duration, and any creature that enters the Area must make the same **Body** check again. 
> 
> ***Vortex:*** Choose a space within range. A vortex of water opens up from that space. All creatures in the Area must make a **Reflex** check. On a failure, they are pulled into the center of the Area. At the start of a creature's turn, if they are within the vortex, they must make another **Reflex** check, with the same outcome.
