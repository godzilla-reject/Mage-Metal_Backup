> ##### *Details*
> You brandish your catalyst, creating a plume of flame within range. Make a melee spell attack. If you hit, you deal `dice: 1d4` fire damage, and the target must make a **Body** check with favor. On a failure, they gain the [[Ignited]] condition.

> ***Immolation Effect***
> If the target is already Ignited, Ignition deals `dice: 1d6` fire damage instead.
