> ###### *Details*
> You construct a spiked-mouth trap resembling the old-world "bear trap." Mark a single space within range. For the duration, a trap that deals `dice:1d8` **crushing** damage is placed in that space. It has a Stealth score of 10+2 * your Tier. When an enemy triggers the trap, they must make a **Reflex** check. On a failure, they are [[Immobilized]] until they can Escape and start [[Bleeding\|Bleeding 1d10]].
