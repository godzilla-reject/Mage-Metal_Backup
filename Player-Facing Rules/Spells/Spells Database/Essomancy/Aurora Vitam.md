> ###### *Details*
> You defy your target's doom, pulling them back from the bring of death. Touch one ally that is in a death spiral. They immediately stabilize and fall [[Unconscious]] and you must make a TN 12 flat check. On a failure, you take 2dE **true** damage as fate pushes back against your tampering.
