> ###### *Details*
> You conjure a roiling dome of fast-moving air within range. Due to the speed of the swirling area, ranged attacks that pass through it are made without favor unless that attack has the [[Air]] trait. The dome does not obscure vision. When you Sustain this spell, you can Move to any space within the dome as part of that action.
