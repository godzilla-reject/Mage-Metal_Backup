> ###### *Details*
> You twist a small funnel of air into existence in a space within range. A howling cyclone torrents forth from it, dealing  `dice:1d4` **cutting** damage to all creatures within the Area. All creatures who take damage this way must then make a **Power** check. On a failure, the creature is [[Flustered]] for `dice: 1d6` rounds, or 1 minute on a critical failure. As a part of casting this spell, you can Move 2 spaces straight backwards, plus another space for each creature that fails their check.
