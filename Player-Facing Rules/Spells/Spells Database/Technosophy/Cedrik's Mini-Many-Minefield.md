> ###### *Details*
> You place multiple mini-mines around you. Mark 4 spaces within range. These mines last for 1 minute. For the duration, whenever a foe enters one of the marked spaces, they must make a **Reflex** check. On a failure, they take `dice:2d6` **fire** damage and are pushed back one space. On a success, they take 2 **fire** damage and are not pushed back.
