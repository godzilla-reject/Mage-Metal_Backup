> ###### *Details*
> You utter a strange string of techno-babble that can cause machines and people alike to become confused. Pick one creature that can hear you. It must make a **Tenacity** check. On a failure, it becomes [[Confused]] for `dice: 1d4` rounds.. If it is linked to a Metal, it also loses one action on its next turn.
