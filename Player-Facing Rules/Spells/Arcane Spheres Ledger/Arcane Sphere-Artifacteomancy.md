*"Artifacteomancy (ar-teh-fakt-TEO-man-cee), Elvish; defined as the study of the three most fundamental forms of magic: runes, words, and movement."*
- - -
***Artifacteomancy*** is the fundamental sphere of magic. *All* mages learn the fundamentals via this school; artifacteomancy, commonly shortened to artifacty, teaches the most basic spell-forms: rune, word, and motion. Mages that choose to specialize in this sphere take their mastery of the most basic aspects of spell-casting to the extreme, casting spells that forgo complex effects in exchange for some of the most powerful and potent single actions possible. 

This sphere rewards dedication and practice, as many Mages find themselves bored with it long before seeing the deep depths of what the sphere has to offer.
