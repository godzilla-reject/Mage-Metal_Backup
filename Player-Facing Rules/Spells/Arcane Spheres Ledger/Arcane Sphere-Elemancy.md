"*Elemancy (el-eh-MAN-cee), Elvish; defined as the study and understanding of magic that originates from the **Elemental Expanse**, a vast maelstrom of chaos that roils with raw, unrefined power.*"
- - -
Elemancy is one of the easiest spheres for beginner mages to learn; the power of the Expanse is everywhere, all around them, and thus, even new mages can access it to conjure fire, water, and other powerful elements. Mages who specialize in this sphere can be underestimated due to many mages' perception that the sphere is weak due to being simple, but in simplicity, one can find power. 

This sphere rewards patience and devotion, though many mages refuse to stick with it long enough to see its greater power.
